      <h4>Support for DDR4 XMP up to 3333MHz</h4>
      <p>

DDR4 memory modules are available at a stock frequency of 2133MHz, but memory vendors encode XMP profiles which can automatically modify the frequency and timings of the supported memory modules to work in par with your CPU. With the X99 Champion Series, GIGABYTE is offering a tested and proven platform that ensures proper compatibility with profiles up to 3333MHz. <br><br>

<strong>What is XMP?</strong><br><br>
The synchronization of the memory modules with the CPU is crucial for good performance of your system. DDR4 memory modules are available at a stock frequency of 2133MHz, but as frequency tweaking requires a considerable amount of effort and knowledge, memory vendors encode XMP profiles which can automatically modify the timings of the supported memory modules to work with your CPU and to achieve increased performance. <br><br>

* XMP Profile support may vary depending on memory module. Please refer "Memory Support List" for more information.

The hardware is good looking in a black and yellow gold color scheme and ambient LED. It appears to be well designed and constructed with no corners cut. The specs on hardware/capacitors/PCB/chokes are solid on this board with good power delivery for core I7 2011-v3 processors, which is currently limited to a couple high end processors. I use an i7 5820k. This motherboard has 8 DDR4 sockets and supports up to 64 GB of system memory, but in my configuration was 4 channel DDR using G.SKILL Ripjaws 4 series 16GB (4 x 4GB), which were compatible with no issues. There is support for faster ram up to 3333 MHz. It supports up to 4-way graphics, depending on CPU, and with the necessary SLI connector. There are plenty of connections for SATA and 1 SATA express, as well as dual M.2 and Wifi card support. Onboard sound is a Realtek ALC1150 with independent right and left channel and with support up to 7.1 playback, and built in Rear Audio amplifier. The audio sounded good to me in a variety of music and video and games. There are four PCI Express x16 slots and the speeds depend on the CPU used, so check the specs. There are 3 PCI Express x1 slots. Combined, there are ample expansion slots and Thunderbolt capability. Warranty is a standard 3 years.

Installation of the CPU &amp; RAM and other hardware was without issue. The software drivers I used were the Windows 10 64-bit drivers on Gigabyte’s website, which worked just fine. Performance and stability was great. The BIOS contains all the settings (i.e. frequency, voltage, etc.) in intuitive locations. Overclocking, directly using the familiar BIOS (or optionally using EasyTune in Windows to overclock CPU/RAM etc.) took the chip to the temperature limit of air cooling using a Noctua NH-D14 SE2011. The APP center includes the EasyTune and other Cloud Station Utilities that may be of interest to some users. 

In summary, this is a premium X99 motherboard that can be the basis for an extremely fast system for productivity use, video encoding, high resolution gaming, or nearly any need.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->Only one Ethernet port is not an issue for me, but could be for some</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->Similar to other modern high end motherboards, there are no PCI slots for legacy devices, e.g. tv tuners, but this does not impact most users of this board.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">6 out of 6 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/d/profile/reviews/c2o3RWN4MkY3ZlgzTkhTdlZTMlZIdz09" title="View Justin B.&#x27;s Profile" target="_blank" data-t-events="A" data-t-e-var78="$ - Profile:c2o3RWN4MkY3ZlgzTkhTdlZTMlZIdz09">Justin B.</a></div><div class="comments-text">Ownership: 1 week to 1 month</div><div class="comments-text comments-eggxpert"><a href="#" class="open-popup"><img alt="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/webResource/Themes/2005/Nest/none.gif"/> <!-- -->Eggxpert Review</a></div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-5"></i><span class="comments-title-content">Works great</span><span class="comments-text">9/3/2015 2:55:17 AM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->•	Great price for what&#x27;s essentially an entry-level high-end motherboard.
•	CPU overclocking works great.
•	Support for Xeon processors and an insane amount of memory and hard drives, if you&#x27;re so inclined.
•	Very attractive in a windowed case.
•	PS/2 plugs for the gamer-oriented (who is this board&#x27;s target market, after all). If you don&#x27;t understand why, Google it.   I can&#x27;t tell the difference between PS/2 and USB, but others swear they can.
•	Includes a license for cFosSpeed traffic-shaping software, if you&#x27;re so inclined. I didn&#x27;t test this as I think it has dubious use. Hardwire it into a gigabit connection and be done.
•	Can flash the bios via USB without having memory or a CPU installed. Pretty hot!
•	The retail box prominently advertises this board as &quot;ultra durable.&quot; I didn&#x27;t run it over with my car, but it seemed to live through installation and testing, so it does indeed appear to be ultra durable.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->•	Bios is kind of a pain to use. Lots and lots of options buried in there. They need to work on this area.  Everything&#x27;s there, but you&#x27;ll need to hunt around.  
•	Memory overclocking was lackluster. Could be my memory.  You probably won&#x27;t see a ton of real-world benefit from memory OC&#x27;ing anyway, so no biggie.
•	May have issues with RAID across specific SATA ports.  The manual available on Gigabyte&#x27;s website has more specifics on this, so skim that area ahead of time if it may affect you.
•	4 rear USB2 ports. I really wish USB 2 would die!
•	No Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.  You probably won&#x27;t miss Wi-Fi since you should hardwire this guy anyway, but you may miss Bluetooth (just get a dongle). 
•	M.2 PCIe connector is in a weird place.  If you use it, it may or may not get in the way of a PCI-E card.  Take a look at the pictures for more info.</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->•	This board worked great for its intended purpose.  Processor overclocking was very easy, stable, and returned awesome results.  If you&#x27;re in the market for a high-end gaming motherboard with easy overclocking potential, I can recommend this item to you. Combined with the aggressively low price as compared to the competition, this board really is a no-brainer.  
•	This board is meant to be used as either a high-end desktop gaming build or as a home server. 
•	As always, check the manufacturer&#x27;s website for CPU &amp; memory compatibility. This doesn&#x27;t always matter with standard desktop boards, but for the high-end performance machines, I suggest sticking with their supported list.
•	As always, update your BIOS to the latest version, and check for updates often for the first few months to make sure you have the most bug-free, stable version.
•	It may be &quot;ultra durable,&quot; but it&#x27;s only a matter of time before a competitor comes out with &quot;super duper durable.&quot;  It&#x27;s up to you if it&#x27;s worth biting now or if you want to wait for the extra increased durability. 
•	CPU - Intel Core i7-5820K Haswell-E 6-Core 3.3GHz LGA 2011-v3 140W BX80648I75820K Desktop Processor.  If you have this CPU, too, please note that 4-Way NVIDIA SLI does NOT work since this CPU doesn&#x27;t have enough PCI-E lanes (24 vs the required 40). 3-way DOES.
•	Memory - CORSAIR DOMINATOR Platinum 16GB (4 x 4GB) 288-Pin DDR4 SDRAM DDR4 2666 (PC4-21300) Desktop Memory Model CMD16GX4M4A2666C15
•	GPU - 2 x MSI GeForce GTX 980 GTX 980 GAMING 4G 4GB 256-Bit GDDR5 PCI Express 3.0 x16 HDCP Ready SLI Support G-SYNC Support Video Card
•	Case - Fractal Design Define R5 Blackout with Window Black Computer Case

Quality components (solid caps) and the thick PCB layout really make this board stand-out as soon as you lay your eyes on it.  It&#x27;s really obvious this is a premium board from Gigabyte and the attention to detail across the entire board exudes excellent craftsmanship.  So first and foremost, Gigabyte deserves high praise for clearly not cutting any corners here, from start to finish.

The new BiOS layout is really quite the looker.  Color scheme depends on your personal taste, but Gigabyte has done a great job making all of the information you need immediately available to you.  Clock settings, voltages, temperatures, etc, are all available from the launch window and are instantly accessible.  There have been a lot of improvements to BiOS utilities from many manufacturers over the last few years and Gigabyte is definitely continuing to improve even more in those areas.

EasyTune is a great app for tweaking your clock/power settings, it&#x27;s convenient to be able to access most of the BiOS features from your OS.  Useful for making minor changes that aren&#x27;t worth rebooting for.  I found the layout of the app itself to be a bit clunky but nothing that actually made it harder to use.

I really appreciate the care and effort that went into the audio portion of the board, it&#x27;s nice to see more companies using higher quality components and boosting audio output quality.  Gaming and music both sound fantastic and it&#x27;s clear Gigabyte made some really great decisions in their implementation.

The board supports M.2 for wireless, with a built-in mounting clip on the back, should you need it.

Also natively supports DDR4-3333 (OC), which is a nice bonus since some X99 boards don&#x27;t quite reach that far.

And of course this board supports some other great features of X99:  Quad-channel RAM, four video card slots (2x PCI-E x16 with the right CPU), DDR4, and a whole host of storage connector options.

Overall this motherboard was a pleasure to work with, it was fluid and response for the duration of installation, setup, and in-use.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->Would have like to have seen two Ethernet ports, but I realize it&#x27;s uncommon these days so I won&#x27;t hold it against Gigabyte.

There have been many BiOS updates released for the Gigabyte X99 series boards over the last few months, I&#x27;m glad to see these new revs have most of the early issues taken care of.  Some of the problems described in older reviews/models weren&#x27;t present in this X99 board so it seems Gigabyte is shipping this board with the newest BiOS (or at least my specific model).

Please make sure you have the latest BiOS when running any X99 board.</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->Had some issues with one of the RAM clips on the board not fully latching.  Possibly would have broken the clips/RAM itself I didn&#x27;t notice that it wasn&#x27;t clasping automatically.  Flicking the latch out manually seemed to have fixed it for the most part.  Always be careful and delicate when assembling your PC!

The &#x27;classic&#x27; BiOS is more geared toward advanced users so it might be worth switching if you want quicker access to the features you&#x27;re looking for.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">2 out of 2 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/d/profile/reviews/a0J1Y24yZW5sb2pIUUt6L1MwMFdDQT09" title="View Bruce L.&#x27;s Profile" target="_blank" data-t-events="A" data-t-e-var78="$ - Profile:a0J1Y24yZW5sb2pIUUt6L1MwMFdDQT09">Bruce L.</a></div><div class="comments-text">Ownership: 1 week to 1 month</div><div class="comments-text comments-eggxpert"><a href="#" class="open-popup"><img alt="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/webResource/Themes/2005/Nest/none.gif"/> <!-- -->Eggxpert Review</a></div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-5"></i><span class="comments-title-content">Great gaming and work motherboard for overclocking</span><span class="comments-text">8/12/2015 10:54:50 PM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->Advanced architecture -  for serious gaming and work.  6Gb/s for optimal SDD speeds.

Better Mounting Holes: More copper is used to reinforce the mounting holes.  Noticed that it was tougher than my last board.  Gigibyte makes very tough motherboards, and this one is the toughest I have seen.

Layout - excellent layout of the board, allowing for effective airflow and placement of components.

RAM - Up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM

GPU support - Both Nivida and AMD boards are support, like most motherboards.  Both are setup for quad function, enabling 16 displays from 4 GPU&#x27;s.  Think wall of monitors!!

SATA - 10X 6G Ports for amazing speed.  SATA Express. 

Included cables - Power extension cable, Crossfire bridge, SLI bridge and SATA cables.

CPU location - Perfect location for air cooling, which I am using, but I don&#x27;t think I would want to try to fit a water cooling system.

PCI-Express design - You can have 8x8x8x8 or 16x0x16x0 to pick from.

Overclocking Software - Unlike my previous Gigabyte motherboards, this has an easy and effective overclocking software that is Windows based.  You have six different options to pick from to fit your computing needs.  Manual overclocking is a pleasure and easy.

Q-Flash - You are now able to flash the Bios without a CPU.

Audio and Video - Excellent system with plenty of power.

USB 3.0 and UASP support. - The USB 3.0 tested faster than any other motherboard I have tested!  84 MB per sec.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->Bios- previous Bios&#x27;s were acceptable, but this one is the worst I have ever come across.  I never know if I have saved my changes in the start menu.

Firmware - Updates are needed to make the BIOS work as well as other motherboards.  There are cold boot and reboot issue that need addressing.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/d/profile/reviews/OVRrNXZDU1R5bUZaR01hWXVpeStFdz09" title="View Scott S.&#x27;s Profile" target="_blank" data-t-events="A" data-t-e-var78="$ - Profile:OVRrNXZDU1R5bUZaR01hWXVpeStFdz09">Scott S.</a></div><div class="comments-text">Ownership: 1 week to 1 month</div><div class="comments-text comments-eggxpert"><a href="#" class="open-popup"><img alt="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/webResource/Themes/2005/Nest/none.gif"/> <!-- -->Eggxpert Review</a></div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-5"></i><span class="comments-title-content">Gigabyte GA-X99-SLI   Well Done</span><span class="comments-text">7/28/2015 5:13:12 AM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->Gigabyte GA-X99-SLI

Gigabyte is really stepping up in their motherboard design these motherboards are well laid out and look awesome.
 
Some first impressions

The I/O ports where all your peripherals connect to is back-light with led’s now making finding that pesky USB port in the dark under desk a lot easier.

The 8 memory slots will hold 128GB of DDR4 3333 (OC) Ram. (Quad Channel)

This motherboard is purpose built for Use of SLI graphics Cards, 

You get 2 x PCI Express x16 slots, running at x16 and 2 x PCI Express x16 slots, running at x8.

Gigabyte is including the M.2 for on-board SSD.

M.2 WIFI adapter port and it has the Wi-Fi antenna mount are rear I/O panel.

A new feature I’ve noticed it the Q flash where you can flash bios via usb stick even when there is not CPU or Ram installed.

I know that on-board sound is not a new thing almost every motherboard comes with it but Gigabyte is taking it to the next level.

Gigabyte has implemented independent right and left channel sections of the board, and this include the full sound portion separated from rest of the motherboard using these nifty led strips that you can set to move with music.

Gigabyte also has a new Screw mounting hole size they have kept a larger area around the mounting screw holes for assembly so you have more room to work and don’t accidentally slip off screw and chip off a microscopic component.

This motherboard is Thunderbolt Ready.

The 2 layer copper core and the the copper plating of this performance motherboard will definitely extend the longevity.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->Not really a con but I like to see more colors that pop on a motherboard this is cool being all blacked out there will be builders that will love this feature.</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->I would highly recommend this motherboard to the hardcore gamer or graphics designer plenty of speed and power and plenty of expansion</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">3 out of 4 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/d/profile/reviews/OUUxeTVDdXNVTGs3YmZ5bk81WUJIUT09" title="View Tracy T.&#x27;s Profile" target="_blank" data-t-events="A" data-t-e-var78="$ - Profile:OUUxeTVDdXNVTGs3YmZ5bk81WUJIUT09">Tracy T.</a></div><div class="comments-text">Ownership: 1 month to 1 year</div><div class="comments-text comments-eggxpert"><a href="#" class="open-popup"><img alt="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/webResource/Themes/2005/Nest/none.gif"/> <!-- -->Eggxpert Review</a></div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-2"></i><span class="comments-title-content">Good motherboard but quality is an issue</span><span class="comments-text">11/6/2015 9:15:55 PM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->The GA-X99-SLI is a full featured motherboard that offers 4 way SLI or Crossfire and quad channel memory.  I installed all the components and selected a CoolerMaster Hyper212 EVO HSF.  There was plenty of clearance for the RAM.  There would be no issues if you chose to populate all eight slots.  I only used 4 slots with a 4x4GB set of G.Skill Ripjaws 4 DDR4-3000. Gigabyte includes a great selection of software to bring out all of the features of this motherboard.  The Easytune software offered several options for overclocking.  I selected the extreme setting in Easytune.  It made all the changes and had the I7-5820k running at 4.20GHz without issue.   I was able to manually get the processor up to a 4.4 GHz overclock.   I have had no issues using this machine everyday with the Easytune 4.20GHz overclock in place.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->When I received the motherboard their were some bent pins.  I went ahead and installed the CPU, ram and attempted to boot the board.  The lights on the board would flash and the fans would spin.  The lights would then turn out and the fans would stop.  The board would then start the boot process again.  I attempted to boot using several different sticks of RAM in multiple different slot combinations.  I sent the board back to Gigabyte.  They sent the board back to me allegedly “repaired”.  I installed the components and powered on the board.  It immediately went into the boot  up, light flash, fan spin up /spin down loop.  I sent the board in to Gigabyte and they sent me a different motherboard.  Board number two has been running for two weeks without issue.  I am disappointed that board number one was sent back to me when it was obviously defective.
Another con with this motherboard is the bios.  The UEFI bios allows you to use the mouse but mouse movements are awkward.  The mouse jumps and will only move in one axis at a time.  I could not move the mouse in a diagonal path.  I quickly abandon the mouse went with the classic view and just used the keyboard to navigate and make my changes.  Be sure to update the bios to the latest version.</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->Once I had a working motherboard in my hands, I put this board through multiple burn in tests.  I did not experience any errors.  This board was rock solid.  If Gigabyte could get their quality control in place and ensure these boards were reliable, I would not hesitate to recommend it.  This motherboard has a ton of features:  6 SATA 6GB/s ports along with two m2 ports so you can have msata ssd and a wifi card.  The onboard sound card compares very well to the external cards I normally use.  Gigabyte included LED lighting for the back panel and I/O shield.  You can have it on or off, set it to pulse or follow the beat of the music or sound being played.  It is a neat feature but since most machines sit under a desk or face a wall, hardly anyone will ever see it.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">2 out of 3 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/d/profile/reviews/dzhBNUpKbVJVYUg0RS85STlCYnZhUT09" title="View Ethan H.&#x27;s Profile" target="_blank" data-t-events="A" data-t-e-var78="$ - Profile:dzhBNUpKbVJVYUg0RS85STlCYnZhUT09">Ethan H.</a></div><div class="comments-text">Ownership: 1 month to 1 year</div><div class="comments-text comments-eggxpert"><a href="#" class="open-popup"><img alt="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/webResource/Themes/2005/Nest/none.gif"/> <!-- -->Eggxpert Review</a></div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-5"></i><span class="comments-title-content">Excellent value</span><span class="comments-text">8/19/2015 10:58:36 AM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->Gigabyte&#x27;s X99-SLI is an intriguing package. It offers high-end features at low-end prices. Other X99 motherboards supporting four video cards cost significantly more – up to twice the price of the X99-SLI. Only consider this board if you have a Haswell-E processor with 40 PCIE lanes. Anything less and you&#x27;re paying for capabilities the CPU cannot use. Also fill four memory slots, as both the X99-SLI supports quad-channel access.

Cannibalizing other workstations to collect four each of GTX 980 and 970 video cards did not make me the most popular one in the office. Once I did, the results were impressive. Frame rates with 980 cards were amazing, 970 cards very good. That said, I recommend using three video cards at most. This activates two slots at x16 bandwidth and one at x8 as opposed to four cards with x8/x8/x16/x8. Average performance with three cards was over 90% of what I saw with four cards.

Another configuration the X99-SLI is well suited for is a workstation having buckets of memory and additional RAID, network, or dedicated GPU compute cards. I tested it with a Xeon E5-2660] and saw better overall performance with two cards than the Supermicro-based server I pulled the CPU and DDR4 memory from.

The X99-SLI can flash a BIOS without CPU or memory being installed. Insert a thumb drive with the new BIOS, power on, done. This proved essential as the BIOS that shipped with the motherboard could not recognize the CPU I initially used. Download the and flash newest BIOS before doing anything else. Gigabyte includes redundant BIOS chips, so no matter how badly you screw up the settings, you can recover.

From a usability standpoint, the CPU area is free from nearby obstructions. Any heatsink designed for LGA-2011v3 should work.

Baseline, non-overclocked system system performance  was good. The X99-SLI handily beat comparable Z97 chipset systems with the same processor. Compared to two Asus X99 systems, however, the Gigabyte board averaged 5% slower at stock speeds.

Gigabyte supplies all the tools for overclocking. The socket supports the full 2089 pins for enhanced power delivery and the advanced (non-GUI) BIOS mode exposes more settings than most. I found that achieving stable overclocks on the Gigabyte X99-SLI required setting CPU voltage slightly higher than an equivalent speed on Asus boards. I also needed to adjust the bump VCCIO up to 1.15 or 1.2V, while Asus managed to work with VCCIO at stock settings. 

Memory overclocking was OK at best. Definitely check Gigabyte&#x27;s site for compatibility listing. XMP profiles for compatible modules worked perfectly, while others were hit-or-miss.

Overall, Gigabyte provides an excellent performer for the price. Top-end performance is not up to that of higher end models, but then neither is the cost. You don&#x27;t get flashy light displays or accessories. . If you are up to spending a few hours tweaking and checking, the X99-SLI gives outstanding performance while saving you money to get</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->Unlike with higher end models, Gigabyte does not include any SLI bridges with the X99-SLI. Depending on whether you already have bridges, you should check Newegg for prices first before deciding on this board or the next one up the model ladder.

The M.2 drive is disappointing. Gigabyte allocates only two lanes for the slot, meaning that reasonably fast drives saturate the bus well before the maximum transfer rate for the drive is reached. I measured 30% slower overall throughput on a Samsung 850 EVO drive with the X99-SLI than on a system having more lanes dedicated to the M.2. Making matters worse, the M.2 slot is positioned between slots 2 and 3. Multi-GPU systems - the reason you would get the X99-SLI - dump enough heat here that the M.2 drive overheated during gaming and throttled repeatedly. Drive lifetime would undoubtedly suffer as well. Unless you use an extension cable, the M.2 slot ends up being of little use.

Gigabyte is always on the bleeding edge as far as features go The BIOS that shipped with the board did not recognize a Xeon procesor, nor would Windows 10 install cleanly using a i7-5930K. Flashing to the latest BIOS solved all problems. Win 8.1, 10, Server 2012 R2, and Ubuntu 15.04 all installed with no drama.

The included EasyTune overclocking software was easy to use. Unfortunately it did not give even close to optimum settings. For example, with a i7-5930K that stably overclocked to 4.6 GHz on other boards (at sane voltages), EasyTune could only give 4.0 GHz at higher voltages. The full GUI BIOS control was worse still. 3.9 GHz maximum. Dumping EasyTune and using the advanced (non-GUI) BIOS settings, I managed to achieve the same 4.6GHz although VCCIO needed a slight boost.

There also is no good fan monitoring and control software in the Gigabyte bundle. I recommend not installing any of the bundled bloatware and using a combination of BIOS tuning and other system monitoring and fan control software.</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->Gigabyte&#x27;s UEFI BIOS displays a large welcome screen that takes up real estate without providing useful information or settings. You need to first select the &quot;Smart Tweak Mode&quot; and then choose &quot;High Resolution&quot; to access necessary system settings. Once you do, there is little organization or flow to the settings. Making matters worse, you still can&#x27;t adjust parameters necessary for optimum overclocking. Gigabyte apparently assumes you will only use the EZ-Mode basic setups or the EasyTune software from within Windows. Gigabyte simply is not competitive with other manufacturers in terms of UEFI BIOS design or functionality.


Luckily it is possible to set the BIOS to advanced/classic mode and adjust everything to your heart&#x27;s content. You step back a decade in user interface design, but Gigabyte exposes a wealth of settings. Amazingly, many settings even have documentation on what they do.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">2 out of 3 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/d/profile/reviews/RTMrSTdyL3lteTVNVk1IVWRlRkFLRHhPeWNJOW9SN2w%3D" title="View Christopher M.&#x27;s Profile" target="_blank" data-t-events="A" data-t-e-var78="$ - Profile:RTMrSTdyL3lteTVNVk1IVWRlRkFLRHhPeWNJOW9SN2w=">Christopher M.</a></div><div class="comments-text">Ownership: 1 month to 1 year</div><div class="comments-text comments-eggxpert"><a href="#" class="open-popup"><img alt="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/webResource/Themes/2005/Nest/none.gif"/> <!-- -->Eggxpert Review</a></div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-5"></i><span class="comments-title-content">Once Around The Ride</span><span class="comments-text">9/2/2015 1:56:21 PM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->Hello. My name is Chris. I am technically inclined, but I like to take the approach of a person reading reviews that doesn’t understand all the “geek speak” and make it understandable for the person who doesn’t have the time or patience to study up on that kind of stuff. I don’t explain ‘benchmarks’, I explain what the item did/does for me plain and simple. If that’s like you, then this review should be very helpful to you.

I recently did a review on the X-99 UD4 motherboard and performance-wise these two mobo&#x27;s are in the same catagory as the X99-UD7 WIFI, X99-UD5 WIFI, X99-UD4P, X99-UD4, X99-UD3P and X99-UD3 with a slight varience between available options. (See &quot;Other Thoughts&quot;).
.
Short of copy and pasting a previous review about the performance aspects of this board (and it&#x27;s sister-boards attributes), I don&#x27;t want to &quot;cheat&quot; this review by doing such a thing to the end user/reader of this review. So I will say check my prior review on the UD4 mobo, check Gigabyte&#x27;s website under the &quot;models&quot; section and see what viable options you personally require for your next build and go with it in that respect. The boards are priced very close to each other, so finding the options that work for you should be easy in that regard (See &quot;Other Thoughts&quot;).
.
What I mean by variences are the number of USB 3.0 ports, the amount of RAM the board can handle, single or dual LAN, etcetera (See &quot;Other Thoughts&quot;).</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->None</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->At the time of accepting this review, I didn&#x27;t realize this MoBo was so much similar to a previous review I had done for Gigabyte and Newegg on the X-99 UD4 model. As it turns out there are SEVERAL models that are so close to each other I personally can&#x27;t understand WHY there are so many variances. There is the X99-UD7 WIFI, X99-UD5 WIFI, X99-UD4P, X99-UD4, X99-UD3P, X99-UD3, and finally the X99-SLI. You can find the differences on Gigabyte&#x27;s website under the &quot;Models&quot; tab at the top right of the website.  Similarities in mine opinion are so minute, it is almost silly to make so many models. Do NOT get me wrong, I am NOT talking bad about this model or any other model of X-99 mobo&#x27;s by Gigabyte, Depending on your needs, requirements and budget, there is DEFINITELY a board that should fit your exact needs for SURE.
.
NOTE: I noticed this mobo was cheaper in price by a few bucks than the UD4 board upon accepting this review, even though in my opinion this board seemed better option-wise. But now at the time of posting my review, I see the prices have been reflected to show in fact this board is now actually priced a few bucks more than the UD4 mobo. Next time I will be doing some research before just accepting another mobo review item from Gigabyte (LOL).

Just because this is a review, please don’t take my words lightly and think I just favor a product because it is sent to me. I have a job to do; and that’s to be fair and honest about the product for future prospective buyers. I am just like you, a Newegg customer. And to me, Newegg reviews are golden. So I am not about to tarnish Newegg reviews OR my good name by telling you something is good when it is not. I hope this review has satisfied your purchasing inquiry needs. Thank you for reading.

The hardware is good looking in a black and yellow gold color scheme and ambient LED. It appears to be well designed and constructed with no corners cut. The specs on hardware/capacitors/PCB/chokes are solid on this board with good power delivery for core I7 2011-v3 processors, which is currently limited to a couple high end processors. I use an i7 5820k. This motherboard has 8 DDR4 sockets and supports up to 64 GB of system memory, but in my configuration was 4 channel DDR using G.SKILL Ripjaws 4 series 16GB (4 x 4GB), which were compatible with no issues. There is support for faster ram up to 3333 MHz. It supports up to 4-way graphics, depending on CPU, and with the necessary SLI connector. There are plenty of connections for SATA and 1 SATA express, as well as dual M.2 and Wifi card support. Onboard sound is a Realtek ALC1150 with independent right and left channel and with support up to 7.1 playback, and built in Rear Audio amplifier. The audio sounded good to me in a variety of music and video and games. There are four PCI Express x16 slots and the speeds depend on the CPU used, so check the specs. There are 3 PCI Express x1 slots. Combined, there are ample expansion slots and Thunderbolt capability. Warranty is a standard 3 years.\n\nInstallation of the CPU & RAM and other hardware was without issue. The software drivers I used were the Windows 10 64-bit drivers on Gigabyte’s website, which worked just fine. Performance and stability was great. The BIOS contains all the settings (i.e. frequency, voltage, etc.) in intuitive locations. Overclocking, directly using the familiar BIOS (or optionally using EasyTune in Windows to overclock CPU/RAM etc.) took the chip to the temperature limit of air cooling using a Noctua NH-D14 SE2011. The APP center includes the EasyTune and other Cloud Station Utilities that may be of interest to some users. \n\nIn summary, this is a premium X99 motherboard that can be the basis for an extremely fast system for productivity use, video encoding, high resolution gaming, or nearly any need.

Quality components (solid caps) and the thick PCB layout really make this board stand-out as soon as you lay your eyes on it.  It's really obvious this is a premium board from Gigabyte and the attention to detail across the entire board exudes excellent craftsmanship.  So first and foremost, Gigabyte deserves high praise for clearly not cutting any corners here, from start to finish.\n\nThe new BiOS layout is really quite the looker.  Color scheme depends on your personal taste, but Gigabyte has done a great job making all of the information you need immediately available to you.  Clock settings, voltages, temperatures, etc, are all available from the launch window and are instantly accessible.  There have been a lot of improvements to BiOS utilities from many manufacturers over the last few years and Gigabyte is definitely continuing to improve even more in those areas.\n\nEasyTune is a great app for tweaking your clock/power settings, it's convenient to be able to access most of the BiOS features from your OS.  Useful for making minor changes that aren't worth rebooting for.  I found the layout of the app itself to be a bit clunky but nothing that actually made it harder to use.\n\nI really appreciate the care and effort that went into the audio portion of the board, it's nice to see more companies using higher quality components and boosting audio output quality.  Gaming and music both sound fantastic and it's clear Gigabyte made some really great decisions in their implementation.\n\nThe board supports M.2 for wireless, with a built-in mounting clip on the back, should you need it.\n\nAlso natively supports DDR4-3333 (OC), which is a nice bonus since some X99 boards don't quite reach that far.\n\nAnd of course this board supports some other great features of X99:  Quad-channel RAM, four video card slots (2x PCI-E x16 with the right CPU), DDR4, and a whole host of storage connector options.\n\nOverall this motherboard was a pleasure to work with, it was fluid and response for the duration of installation, setup, and in-use. Cons: Would have like to have seen two Ethernet ports, but I realize it's uncommon these days so I won't hold it against Gigabyte.\n\nThere have been many BiOS updates released for the Gigabyte X99 series boards over the last few months, I'm glad to see these new revs have most of the early issues taken care of.  Some of the problems described in older reviews/models weren't present in this X99 board so it seems Gigabyte is shipping this board with the newest BiOS (or at least my specific model).\n\nPlease make sure you have the latest BiOS when running any X99 board. Overall Review: Had some issues with one of the RAM clips on the board not fully latching.  Possibly would have broken the clips/RAM itself I didn't notice that it wasn't clasping automatically.  Flicking the latch out manually seemed to have fixed it for the most part.  Always be careful and delicate when assembling your PC!\n\nThe 'classic' BiOS is more geared toward advanced users so it might be worth switching if you want quicker access to the features you're looking for.","name":"Solid X99 board with some great perks!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5","worstRating":"1"}},{"@type":"Review","author":"Bruce L.","datePublished":"2015-08-12","description":"Pros: Advanced architecture -  for serious gaming and work.  6Gb/s for optimal SDD speeds.\n\nBetter Mounting Holes: More copper is used to reinforce the mounting holes.

There are cold boot and reboot issue that need addressing.","name":"Great gaming and work motherboard for overclocking","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5","worstRating":"1"}},{"@type":"Review","author":"Scott S.","datePublished":"2015-07-28","description":"Pros: Gigabyte GA-X99-SLI\n\nGigabyte is really stepping up in their motherboard design these motherboards are well laid out and look awesome.\n \nSome first impressions\n\nThe I/O ports where all your peripherals connect to is back-light with led’s now making finding that pesky USB port in the dark under desk a lot easier.\n\nThe 8 memory slots will hold 128GB of DDR4 3333 (OC) Ram.

I installed all the components and selected a CoolerMaster Hyper212 EVO HSF.  There was plenty of clearance for the RAM.  There would be no issues if you chose to populate all eight slots.  I only used 4 slots with a 4x4GB set of G.Skill Ripjaws 4 DDR4-3000. Gigabyte includes a great selection of software to bring out all of the features of this motherboard.  The Easytune software offered several options for overclocking.  I selected the extreme setting in Easytune.  It made all the changes and had the I7-5820k running at 4.20GHz without issue.   I was able to manually get the processor up to a 4.4 GHz overclock.   I have had no issues using this machine everyday with the Easytune 4.20GHz overclock in place. Cons: When I received the motherboard their were some bent pins.  I went ahead and installed the CPU, ram and attempted to boot the board.  The lights on the board would flash and the fans would spin.  The lights would then turn out and the fans would stop.  The board would then start the boot process again.  I attempted to boot using several different sticks of RAM in multiple different slot combinations.  I sent the board back to Gigabyte.  They sent the board back to me allegedly “repaired”.  I installed the components and powered on the board.  It immediately went into the boot  up, light flash, fan spin up /spin down loop.  I sent the board in to Gigabyte and they sent me a different motherboard.  Board number two has been running for two weeks without issue.  I am disappointed that board number one was sent back to me when it was obviously defective.\nAnother con with this motherboard is the bios.  The UEFI bios allows you to use the mouse but mouse movements are awkward.  The mouse jumps and will only move in one axis at a time.  I could not move the mouse in a diagonal path.  I quickly abandon the mouse went with the classic view and just used the keyboard to navigate and make my changes.  Be sure to update the bios to the latest version. Overall Review: Once I had a working motherboard in my hands, I put this board through multiple burn in tests.  I did not experience any errors.  This board was rock solid.  If Gigabyte could get their quality control in place and ensure these boards were reliable, I would not hesitate to recommend it.  This motherboard has a ton of features:  6 SATA 6GB/s ports along with two m2 ports so you can have msata ssd and a wifi card.  The onboard sound card compares very well to the external cards I normally use.  Gigabyte included LED lighting for the back panel and I/O shield.  You can have it on or off, set it to pulse or follow the beat of the music or sound being played.  It is a neat feature but since most machines sit under a desk or face a wall, hardly anyone will ever see it.","name":"Good motherboard but quality is an issue","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"2","worstRating":"1"}},{"@type":"Review","author":"Ethan H.","datePublished":"2015-08-19","description":"Pros: Gigabyte's X99-SLI is an intriguing package. It offers high-end features at low-end prices. Other X99 motherboards supporting four video cards cost significantly more – up to twice the price of the X99-SLI. Only consider this board if you have a Haswell-E processor with 40 PCIE lanes. Anything less and you're paying for capabilities the CPU cannot use. Also fill four memory slots, as both the X99-SLI supports quad-channel access.\n\nCannibalizing other workstations to collect four each of GTX 980 and 970 video cards did not make me the most popular one in the office. Once I did, the results were impressive. Frame rates with 980 cards were amazing, 970 cards very good. That said, I recommend using three video cards at most. This activates two slots at x16 bandwidth and one at x8 as opposed to four cards with x8/x8/x16/x8. Average performance with three cards was over 90% of what I saw with four cards.\n\nAnother configuration the X99-SLI is well suited for is a workstation having buckets of memory and additional RAID, network, or dedicated GPU compute cards. I tested it with a Xeon E5-2660] and saw better overall performance with two cards than the Supermicro-based server I pulled the CPU and DDR4 memory from.\n\nThe X99-SLI can flash a BIOS without CPU or memory being installed. Insert a thumb drive with the new BIOS, power on, done. This proved essential as the BIOS that shipped with the motherboard could not recognize the CPU I initially used. Download the and flash newest BIOS before doing anything else. Gigabyte includes redundant BIOS chips, so no matter how badly you screw up the settings, you can recover.\n\nFrom a usability standpoint, the CPU area is free from nearby obstructions. Any heatsink designed for LGA-2011v3 should work.\n\nBaseline, non-overclocked system system performance  was good. The X99-SLI handily beat comparable Z97 chipset systems with the same processor. Compared to two Asus X99 systems, however, the Gigabyte board averaged 5% slower at stock speeds.\n\nGigabyte supplies all the tools for overclocking. The socket supports the full 2089 pins for enhanced power delivery and the advanced (non-GUI) BIOS mode exposes more settings than most. I found that achieving stable overclocks on the Gigabyte X99-SLI required setting CPU voltage slightly higher than an equivalent speed on Asus boards. I also needed to adjust the bump VCCIO up to 1.15 or 1.2V, while Asus managed to work with VCCIO at stock settings. \n\nMemory overclocking was OK at best. Definitely check Gigabyte's site for compatibility listing. XMP profiles for compatible modules worked perfectly, while others were hit-or-miss.\n\nOverall, Gigabyte provides an excellent performer for the price. Top-end performance is not up to that of higher end models, but then neither is the cost. You don't get flashy light displays or accessories. . If you are up to spending a few hours tweaking and checking, the X99-SLI gives outstanding performance while saving you money to get Cons: Unlike with higher end models, Gigabyte does not include any SLI bridges with the X99-SLI. Depending on whether you already have bridges, you should check Newegg for prices first before deciding on this board or the next one up the model ladder.\n\nThe M.2 drive is disappointing. Gigabyte allocates only two lanes for the slot, meaning that reasonably fast drives saturate the bus well before the maximum transfer rate for the drive is reached. I measured 30% slower overall throughput on a Samsung 850 EVO drive with the X99-SLI than on a system having more lanes dedicated to the M.2. Making matters worse, the M.2 slot is positioned between slots 2 and 3. Multi-GPU systems - the reason you would get the X99-SLI - dump enough heat here that the M.2 drive overheated during gaming and throttled repeatedly. Drive lifetime would undoubtedly suffer as well. Unless you use an extension cable, the M.2 slot ends up being of little use.\n\nGigabyte is always on the bleeding edge as far as features go The BIOS that shipped with the board did not recognize a Xeon procesor, nor would Windows 10 install cleanly using a i7-5930K. Flashing to the latest BIOS solved all problems. Win 8.1, 10, Server 2012 R2, and Ubuntu 15.04 all installed with no drama.\n\nThe included EasyTune overclocking software was easy to use. Unfortunately it did not give even close to optimum settings. For example, with a i7-5930K that stably overclocked to 4.6 GHz on other boards (at sane voltages), EasyTune could only give 4.0 GHz at higher voltages. The full GUI BIOS control was worse still. 3.9 GHz maximum. Dumping EasyTune and using the advanced (non-GUI) BIOS settings, I managed to achieve the same 4.6GHz although VCCIO needed a slight boost.\n\nThere also is no good fan monitoring and control software in the Gigabyte bundle. I recommend not installing any of the bundled bloatware and using a combination of BIOS tuning and other system monitoring and fan control software. Overall Review: Gigabyte's UEFI BIOS displays a large welcome screen that takes up real estate without providing useful information or settings. You need to first select the \"Smart Tweak Mode\" and then choose \"High Resolution\" to access necessary system settings. Once you do, there is little organization or flow to the settings. Making matters worse, you still can't adjust parameters necessary for optimum overclocking. Gigabyte apparently assumes you will only use the EZ-Mode basic setups or the EasyTune software from within Windows. Gigabyte simply is not competitive with other manufacturers in terms of UEFI BIOS design or functionality.\n\n\nLuckily it is possible to set the BIOS to advanced/classic mode and adjust everything to your heart's content. You step back a decade in user interface design, but Gigabyte exposes a wealth of settings. Amazingly, many settings even have documentation on what they do.","name":"Excellent value","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5","worstRating":"1"}},{"@type":"Review","author":"Christopher M.","datePublished":"2015-09-02","description":"Pros: Hello. My name is Chris. I am technically inclined, but I like to take the approach of a person reading reviews that doesn’t understand all the “geek speak” and make it understandable for the person who doesn’t have the time or patience to study up on that kind of stuff. I don’t explain ‘benchmarks’, I explain what the item did/does for me plain and simple. If that’s like you, then this review should be very helpful to you.\n.\nI recently did a review on the X-99 UD4 motherboard and performance-wise these two mobo's are in the same catagory as the X99-UD7 WIFI, X99-UD5 WIFI, X99-UD4P, X99-UD4, X99-UD3P and X99-UD3 with a slight varience between available options. (See \"Other Thoughts\").\n.\nShort of copy and pasting a previous review about the performance aspects of this board (and it's sister-boards attributes), I don't want to \"cheat\" this review by doing such a thing to the end user/reader of this review. So I will say check my prior review on the UD4 mobo, check Gigabyte's website under the \"models\" section and see what viable options you personally require for your next build and go with it in that respect. The boards are priced very close to each other, so finding the options that work for you should be easy in that regard (See \"Other Thoughts\").\n.\nWhat I mean by variences are the number of USB 3.0 ports, the amount of RAM the board can handle, single or dual LAN, etcetera (See \"Other Thoughts\"). Cons: None Overall Review: At the time of accepting this review, I didn't realize this MoBo was so much similar to a previous review I had done for Gigabyte and Newegg on the X-99 UD4 model. As it turns out there are SEVERAL models that are so close to each other I personally can't understand WHY there are so many variances. There is the X99-UD7 WIFI, X99-UD5 WIFI, X99-UD4P, X99-UD4, X99-UD3P, X99-UD3, and finally the X99-SLI. You can find the differences on Gigabyte's website under the \"Models\" tab at the top right of the website.  Similarities in mine opinion are so minute, it is almost silly to make so many models. Do NOT get me wrong, I am NOT talking bad about this model or any other model of X-99 mobo's by Gigabyte, Depending on your needs, requirements and budget, there is DEFINITELY a board that should fit your exact needs for SURE.\n.\nNOTE: I noticed this mobo was cheaper in price by a few bucks than the UD4 board upon accepting this review, even though in my opinion this board seemed better option-wise. But now at the time of posting my review, I see the prices have been reflected to show in fact this board is now actually priced a few bucks more than the UD4 mobo. Next time I will be doing some research before just accepting another mobo review item from Gigabyte (LOL).\n.\nJust because this is a review, please don’t take my words lightly and think I just favor a product because it is sent to me. I have a job to do; and that’s to be fair and honest about the product for future prospective buyers. I am just like you, a Newegg customer. And to me, Newegg reviews are golden. So I am not about to tarnish Newegg reviews OR my good name by telling you something is good when it is not. I hope this review has satisfied your purchasing inquiry needs. Thank you for reading. And thank you Newegg for allowing me another great opportunity to review.","name":"Once Around The Ride","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5","worstRating":"1"}}]}</script><div id="product-warranty" class="swiper-box-top"><h2 class="swiper-box-top-title">Warranty &amp;

for legacy devices, e.g. tv tuners, but this does not impact most users of this board.","Pros":"The GA-X99-SLI is a motherboard that has many desirable features for the LGA 2011-V3 platform. The hardware is good looking in a black and yellow gold color scheme and ambient LED. It appears to be well designed and constructed with no corners cut. The specs on hardware\u002Fcapacitors\u002FPCB\u002Fchokes are solid on this board with good power delivery for core I7 2011-v3 processors, which is currently limited to a couple high end processors. I use an i7 5820k. This motherboard has 8 DDR4 sockets and supports up to 64 GB of system memory, but in my configuration was 4 channel DDR using G.SKILL Ripjaws 4 series 16GB (4 x 4GB), which were compatible with no issues. There is support for faster ram up to 3333 MHz. It supports up to 4-way graphics, depending on CPU, and with the necessary SLI connector. There are plenty of connections for SATA and 1 SATA express, as well as dual M.2 and Wifi card support. Onboard sound is a Realtek ALC1150 with independent right and left channel and with support up to 7.1 playback, and built in Rear Audio amplifier. The audio sounded good to me in a variety of music and video and games. There are four PCI Express x16 slots and the speeds depend on the CPU used, so check the specs. There are 3 PCI Express x1 slots. Combined, there are ample expansion slots and Thunderbolt capability. Warranty is a standard 3 years.\n\nInstallation of the CPU & RAM and other hardware was without issue. The software drivers I used were the Windows 10 64-bit drivers on Gigabyte’s website, which worked just fine. Performance and stability was great. The BIOS contains all the settings (i.e. frequency, voltage, etc.) in intuitive locations. Overclocking, directly using the familiar BIOS (or optionally using EasyTune in Windows to overclock CPU\u002FRAM etc.) took the chip to the temperature limit of air cooling using a Noctua NH-D14 SE2011. The APP center includes the EasyTune and other Cloud Station Utilities that may be of interest to some users. \n\nIn summary, this is a premium X99 motherboard that can be the basis for an extremely fast system for productivity use, video encoding, high resolution gaming, or nearly any need.","Cons":"Only one Ethernet port is not an issue for me, but could be for some","BoughtTimeType":2,"TechLevelType":5,"TotalVoting":6,"TotalConsented":6,"IsNewReview":true,"IsVoted":false,"PurchaseMark":"2","MostHelpfulMark":false,"ImageStatus":"N","HasProfileLink":true},{"JobTitle":"","MerchantType":"","MerchantIndustry":"","Merchantsize":"","B2bExclusiveReview":"false","CompanyName":"","BrandId":1314,"TotalReviews":53,"SubCategoryId":280,"HasPurchased":false,"WebItemNumber":"N82E16813128829","Item":"13-128-829","BrandDescription":"GIGABYTE","SubCategoryDescription":"Intel Motherboards","ItemDescription":"GIGABYTE GA-X99-SLI (rev. 1.0) LGA 2011-v3 Intel X99 SATA 6Gb\u002Fs USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard","ShowOEMMARK":false,"ShowOEMRetail":true,"HasVendorReplay":false,"ProductImageInfo":{"ItemNumber":"N82E16813128829","ImageTitle":"GIGABYTE GA-X99-SLI (rev. 1.0) LGA 2011-v3 Intel X99 SATA 6Gb\u002Fs USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard","HasWaterMark":false,"IsComboBundleImage":false,"ImageType":0,"IsDFISImage":false,"ImageInternalCount":0,"Scene7ImageInfo":{"ImageName":""},"NormalImageInfo":{"ImageName":"13-128-829-09.jpg","ImageNameList":"13-128-829-09.jpg,13-128-829-10.jpg,13-128-829-11.jpg,13-128-829-12.jpg,13-128-829-13.jpg","DFIS360ImgFlag":"13-128-829_RY"},"ItemType":{"IsDigitalRiverItem":false,"IsDVDItem":false,"IsOpenBoxItem":false,"IsRecertifiedItem":false,"IsAITItem":false,"IsPhoneItem":false,"IsServicePlanItem":false,"IsSimCardItem":false,"IsRestrictedItem":false,"IsComboBundle":false,"IsSimplxityItem":false,"IsProductKeyOnlyItem":false,"IsMicrosoftDownloadItem":false,"IsCellPhoneWithPlanItem":false,"IsStandaloneSNETItem":false,"IsSNETItem":false,"IsCiscoServiceItem":false,"IsClearanceItem":false,"IsBOMDIYItem":false,"IsBOMPOSItem":false,"IsBOMBTOItem":false,"IsAvailableForRegion":true,"IsSubscription":false,"IsRegularSubscription":false,"IsCancelSubscription":false,"IsCommitmentSubscription":false,"IsSubscriptionOnly":false}},"LanguageCode":"en-us","ItemNumber":4417460,"Rating":5,"InDate":"2015-09-03T02:55:17.62","LoginName":"AbOAC2+m4wYFf4sAmQtENHrV0d+sD0NcFeP+HKDZHSQmtA+uyNPPlg==","EncryLoginName":"AbOAC2+m4wYFf4sAmQtENHrV0d+sD0NcFeP+HKDZHSQmtA+uyNPPlg==","Title":"Works great","NickName":"","DisplayName":"Justin B.","CustomerNumber":"sj7Ecx2F7fX3NHSvVS2VHw==","EncryCustomerNumber":"sj7Ecx2F7fX3NHSvVS2VHw==","Comments":"•\tThis board worked great for its intended purpose.  Processor overclocking was very easy, stable, and returned awesome results.  If you're in the market for a high-end gaming motherboard with easy overclocking potential, I can recommend this item to you.

If you don't understand why, Google it.   I can't tell the difference between PS\u002F2 and USB, but others swear they can.\n•\tIncludes a license for cFosSpeed traffic-shaping software, if you're so inclined. I didn't test this as I think it has dubious use. Hardwire it into a gigabit connection and be done.\n•\tCan flash the bios via USB without having memory or a CPU installed. Pretty hot!\n•\tThe retail box prominently advertises this board as \"ultra durable.\" I didn't run it over with my car, but it seemed to live through installation and testing, so it does indeed appear to be ultra durable.","Cons":"•\tBios is kind of a pain to use. Lots and lots of options buried in there. They need to work on this area.  Everything's there, but you'll need to hunt around.  \n•\tMemory overclocking was lackluster. Could be my memory.  You probably won't see a ton of real-world benefit from memory OC'ing anyway, so no biggie.\n•\tMay have issues with RAID across specific SATA ports.  The manual available on Gigabyte's website has more specifics on this, so skim that area ahead of time if it may affect you.\n•\t4 rear USB2 ports.

Possibly would have broken the clips\u002FRAM itself I didn't notice that it wasn't clasping automatically.  Flicking the latch out manually seemed to have fixed it for the most part.  Always be careful and delicate when assembling your PC!\n\nThe 'classic' BiOS is more geared toward advanced users so it might be worth switching if you want quicker access to the features you're looking for.","Pros":"Without a doubt this is one of the sleekest motherboards I've ever laid my hands on.  Quality components (solid caps) and the thick PCB layout really make this board stand-out as soon as you lay your eyes on it.  It's really obvious this is a premium board from Gigabyte and the attention to detail across the entire board exudes excellent craftsmanship.  So first and foremost, Gigabyte deserves high praise for clearly not cutting any corners here, from start to finish.\n\nThe new BiOS layout is really quite the looker.  Color scheme depends on your personal taste, but Gigabyte has done a great job making all of the information you need immediately available to you.  Clock settings, voltages, temperatures, etc, are all available from the launch window and are instantly accessible.  There have been a lot of improvements to BiOS utilities from many manufacturers over the last few years and Gigabyte is definitely continuing to improve even more in those areas.\n\nEasyTune is a great app for tweaking your clock\u002Fpower settings, it's convenient to be able to access most of the BiOS features from your OS.  Useful for making minor changes that aren't worth rebooting for.  I found the layout of the app itself to be a bit clunky but nothing that actually made it harder to use.\n\nI really appreciate the care and effort that went into the audio portion of the board, it's nice to see more companies using higher quality components and boosting audio output quality.  Gaming and music both sound fantastic and it's clear Gigabyte made some really great decisions in their implementation.\n\nThe board supports M.2 for wireless, with a built-in mounting clip on the back, should you need it.\n\nAlso natively supports DDR4-3333 (OC), which is a nice bonus since some X99 boards don't quite reach that far.\n\nAnd of course this board supports some other great features of X99:  Quad-channel RAM, four video card slots (2x PCI-E x16 with the right CPU), DDR4, and a whole host of storage connector options.\n\nOverall this motherboard was a pleasure to work with, it was fluid and response for the duration of installation, setup, and in-use.","Cons":"Would have like to have seen two Ethernet ports, but I realize it's uncommon these days so I won't hold it against Gigabyte.\n\nThere have been many BiOS updates released for the Gigabyte X99 series boards over the last few months, I'm glad to see these new revs have most of the early issues taken care of.

This motherboard has a ton of features:  6 SATA 6GB\u002Fs ports along with two m2 ports so you can have msata ssd and a wifi card.

It is a neat feature but since most machines sit under a desk or face a wall, hardly anyone will ever see it.","Pros":"The GA-X99-SLI is a full featured motherboard that offers 4 way SLI or Crossfire and quad channel memory.  I installed all the components and selected a CoolerMaster Hyper212 EVO HSF.  There was plenty of clearance for the RAM.  There would be no issues if you chose to populate all eight slots.  I only used 4 slots with a 4x4GB set of G.Skill Ripjaws 4 DDR4-3000. Gigabyte includes a great selection of software to bring out all of the features of this motherboard.  The Easytune software offered several options for overclocking.  I selected the extreme setting in Easytune.  It made all the changes and had the I7-5820k running at 4.20GHz without issue.   I was able to manually get the processor up to a 4.4 GHz overclock.   I have had no issues using this machine everyday with the Easytune 4.20GHz overclock in place.","Cons":"When I received the motherboard their were some bent pins.  I went ahead and installed the CPU, ram and attempted to boot the board.  The lights on the board would flash and the fans would spin.  The lights would then turn out and the fans would stop.  The board would then start the boot process again.  I attempted to boot using several different sticks of RAM in multiple different slot combinations.  I sent the board back to Gigabyte.  They sent the board back to me allegedly “repaired”.  I installed the components and powered on the board.  It immediately went into the boot  up, light flash, fan spin up \u002Fspin down loop.  I sent the board in to Gigabyte and they sent me a different motherboard.  Board number two has been running for two weeks without issue.  I am disappointed that board number one was sent back to me when it was obviously defective.\nAnother con with this motherboard is the bios.  The UEFI bios allows you to use the mouse but mouse movements are awkward.  The mouse jumps and will only move in one axis at a time.  I could not move the mouse in a diagonal path.  I quickly abandon the mouse went with the classic view and just used the keyboard to navigate and make my changes.

You need to first select the \"Smart Tweak Mode\" and then choose \"High Resolution\" to access necessary system settings. Once you do, there is little organization or flow to the settings. Making matters worse, you still can't adjust parameters necessary for optimum overclocking. Gigabyte apparently assumes you will only use the EZ-Mode basic setups or the EasyTune software from within Windows. Gigabyte simply is not competitive with other manufacturers in terms of UEFI BIOS design or functionality.\n\n\nLuckily it is possible to set the BIOS to advanced\u002Fclassic mode and adjust everything to your heart's content. You step back a decade in user interface design, but Gigabyte exposes a wealth of settings. Amazingly, many settings even have documentation on what they do.","Pros":"Gigabyte's X99-SLI is an intriguing package. It offers high-end features at low-end prices. Other X99 motherboards supporting four video cards cost significantly more – up to twice the price of the X99-SLI. Only consider this board if you have a Haswell-E processor with 40 PCIE lanes. Anything less and you're paying for capabilities the CPU cannot use. Also fill four memory slots, as both the X99-SLI supports quad-channel access.\n\nCannibalizing other workstations to collect four each of GTX 980 and 970 video cards did not make me the most popular one in the office. Once I did, the results were impressive. Frame rates with 980 cards were amazing, 970 cards very good. That said, I recommend using three video cards at most. This activates two slots at x16 bandwidth and one at x8 as opposed to four cards with x8\u002Fx8\u002Fx16\u002Fx8. Average performance with three cards was over 90% of what I saw with four cards.\n\nAnother configuration the X99-SLI is well suited for is a workstation having buckets of memory and additional RAID, network, or dedicated GPU compute cards. I tested it with a Xeon E5-2660] and saw better overall performance with two cards than the Supermicro-based server I pulled the CPU and DDR4 memory from.\n\nThe X99-SLI can flash a BIOS without CPU or memory being installed. Insert a thumb drive with the new BIOS, power on, done. This proved essential as the BIOS that shipped with the motherboard could not recognize the CPU I initially used. Download the and flash newest BIOS before doing anything else. Gigabyte includes redundant BIOS chips, so no matter how badly you screw up the settings, you can recover.\n\nFrom a usability standpoint, the CPU area is free from nearby obstructions. Any heatsink designed for LGA-2011v3 should work.\n\nBaseline, non-overclocked system system performance  was good. The X99-SLI handily beat comparable Z97 chipset systems with the same processor. Compared to two Asus X99 systems, however, the Gigabyte board averaged 5% slower at stock speeds.\n\nGigabyte supplies all the tools for overclocking. The socket supports the full 2089 pins for enhanced power delivery and the advanced (non-GUI) BIOS mode exposes more settings than most. I found that achieving stable overclocks on the Gigabyte X99-SLI required setting CPU voltage slightly higher than an equivalent speed on Asus boards. I also needed to adjust the bump VCCIO up to 1.15 or 1.2V, while Asus managed to work with VCCIO at stock settings. \n\nMemory overclocking was OK at best. Definitely check Gigabyte's site for compatibility listing. XMP profiles for compatible modules worked perfectly, while others were hit-or-miss.\n\nOverall, Gigabyte provides an excellent performer for the price. Top-end performance is not up to that of higher end models, but then neither is the cost. You don't get flashy light displays or accessories. . If you are up to spending a few hours tweaking and checking, the X99-SLI gives outstanding performance while saving you money to get","Cons":"Unlike with higher end models, Gigabyte does not include any SLI bridges with the X99-SLI. Depending on whether you already have bridges, you should check Newegg for prices first before deciding on this board or the next one up the model ladder.\n\nThe M.2 drive is disappointing. Gigabyte allocates only two lanes for the slot, meaning that reasonably fast drives saturate the bus well before the maximum transfer rate for the drive is reached. I measured 30% slower overall throughput on a Samsung 850 EVO drive with the X99-SLI than on a system having more lanes dedicated to the M.2. Making matters worse, the M.2 slot is positioned between slots 2 and 3. Multi-GPU systems - the reason you would get the X99-SLI - dump enough heat here that the M.2 drive overheated during gaming and throttled repeatedly. Drive lifetime would undoubtedly suffer as well. Unless you use an extension cable, the M.2 slot ends up being of little use.\n\nGigabyte is always on the bleeding edge as far as features go The BIOS that shipped with the board did not recognize a Xeon procesor, nor would Windows 10 install cleanly using a i7-5930K. Flashing to the latest BIOS solved all problems. Win 8.1, 10, Server 2012 R2, and Ubuntu 15.04 all installed with no drama.\n\nThe included EasyTune overclocking software was easy to use. Unfortunately it did not give even close to optimum settings. For example, with a i7-5930K that stably overclocked to 4.6 GHz on other boards (at sane voltages), EasyTune could only give 4.0 GHz at higher voltages. The full GUI BIOS control was worse still. 3.9 GHz maximum. Dumping EasyTune and using the advanced (non-GUI) BIOS settings, I managed to achieve the same 4.6GHz although VCCIO needed a slight boost.\n\nThere also is no good fan monitoring and control software in the Gigabyte bundle.

There is the X99-UD7 WIFI, X99-UD5 WIFI, X99-UD4P, X99-UD4, X99-UD3P, X99-UD3, and finally the X99-SLI. You can find the differences on Gigabyte's website under the \"Models\" tab at the top right of the website.  Similarities in mine opinion are so minute, it is almost silly to make so many models. Do NOT get me wrong, I am NOT talking bad about this model or any other model of X-99 mobo's by Gigabyte, Depending on your needs, requirements and budget, there is DEFINITELY a board that should fit your exact needs for SURE.\n.\nNOTE: I noticed this mobo was cheaper in price by a few bucks than the UD4 board upon accepting this review, even though in my opinion this board seemed better option-wise. But now at the time of posting my review, I see the prices have been reflected to show in fact this board is now actually priced a few bucks more than the UD4 mobo. Next time I will be doing some research before just accepting another mobo review item from Gigabyte (LOL).\n.\nJust because this is a review, please don’t take my words lightly and think I just favor a product because it is sent to me. I have a job to do; and that’s to be fair and honest about the product for future prospective buyers. I am just like you, a Newegg customer. And to me, Newegg reviews are golden. So I am not about to tarnish Newegg reviews OR my good name by telling you something is good when it is not. I hope this review has satisfied your purchasing inquiry needs. Thank you for reading. And thank you Newegg for allowing me another great opportunity to review.","Pros":"Hello. My name is Chris. I am technically inclined, but I like to take the approach of a person reading reviews that doesn’t understand all the “geek speak” and make it understandable for the person who doesn’t have the time or patience to study up on that kind of stuff. I don’t explain ‘benchmarks’, I explain what the item did\u002Fdoes for me plain and simple. If that’s like you, then this review should be very helpful to you.\n.\nI recently did a review on the X-99 UD4 motherboard and performance-wise these two mobo's are in the same catagory as the X99-UD7 WIFI, X99-UD5 WIFI, X99-UD4P, X99-UD4, X99-UD3P and X99-UD3 with a slight varience between available options. (See \"Other Thoughts\").\n.\nShort of copy and pasting a previous review about the performance aspects of this board (and it's sister-boards attributes), I don't want to \"cheat\" this review by doing such a thing to the end user\u002Freader of this review. So I will say check my prior review on the UD4 mobo, check Gigabyte's website under the \"models\" section and see what viable options you personally require for your next build and go with it in that respect. The boards are priced very close to each other, so finding the options that work for you should be easy in that regard (See \"Other Thoughts\").\n.\nWhat I mean by variences are the number of USB 3.0 ports, the amount of RAM the board can handle, single or dual LAN, etcetera (See \"Other Thoughts\").","Cons":"None","BoughtTimeType":4,"TechLevelType":5,"TotalVoting":0,"TotalConsented":0,"IsNewReview":true,"IsVoted":false,"PurchaseMark":"2","MostHelpfulMark":false,"ImageStatus":"N","HasProfileLink":true}],"ReviewCategoryList":[]},"ThreeSummaries":[{"Company_code":"1003","Country_code":"USA","In_date":"2020-08-29 02:20:46.683","Item_number":"13-128-829","Last_edit_date":"2020-08-29 02:20:46.683","Login_name":"Timothy D.","Priority":"1","Review_id":"4722208","Similar_review_count":"4","Summary":"Gold plated CPU, RAM, PCIE slots for superior connection.","Display_Name":"Timothy D.","Customer_Number":"Es5i9ZwWlNJWzuOExGNjZrdurl9dvjyu","EncryCustomerNumber":"Es5i9ZwWlNJWzuOExGNjZrdurl9dvjyu","BoughtTimeType":4,"HasProfileLink":true},{"Company_code":"1003","Country_code":"USA","In_date":"2020-08-29 02:20:46.683","Item_number":"13-128-829","Last_edit_date":"2020-08-29 02:20:46.683","Login_name":"Paige A.","Priority":"2","Review_id":"4543559","Similar_review_count":"4","Summary":"This would have been the perfect board if the Audio hardware worked.","Display_Name":"Paige A.","Customer_Number":"7i4DvSZLDYAQEdmi5DJhlwOMnaDl+KTz","EncryCustomerNumber":"7i4DvSZLDYAQEdmi5DJhlwOMnaDl+KTz","BoughtTimeType":4,"HasProfileLink":true},{"Company_code":"1003","Country_code":"USA","In_date":"2020-08-29 02:20:46.683","Item_number":"13-128-829","Last_edit_date":"2020-08-29 02:20:46.683","Login_name":"","Priority":"3","Review_id":"4471519","Similar_review_count":"4","Summary":"When I received the motherboard their were some bent pins.","Display_Name":"Tracy T.","Customer_Number":"9E1y5CusULk7bfynO5YBHQ==","EncryCustomerNumber":"9E1y5CusULk7bfynO5YBHQ==","BoughtTimeType":4,"HasProfileLink":true}]},"SNS":{"PageDescription":"GIGABYTE GA-X99-SLI (rev. 1.0) LGA 2011-v3 Intel X99 SATA 6Gb\u002Fs USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard","PageTitle":"GIGABYTE GA-X99-SLI (rev. 1.0) LGA 2011-v3 ATX Intel Motherboard","ProductTitle":"GIGABYTE GA-X99-SLI (rev. 1.0) LGA 2011-v3 Intel X99 SATA 6Gb\u002Fs USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard"}}</script><script src="/dynamic-js/product/ProductWithoutKeyword/USA/initial-json"></script><script defer="">window.__neweggState__ = {"country":{"name":"United States","alpha2":"us","alpha3":"USA","geoLocation":"North America","currency":"USD"},"user":{"nvtc":"string","contactWith":"string","loginName":"string","accessToken":"string","lastVisitTime":1,"loginId":"string","isEggExpert":true,"loginToken":"string","isPremier":true,"isLogin":true},"domains":{"WWW":"www.newegg.com","SSL":"secure.newegg.com","MOBILESSL":"secure.m.newegg.com","COM":"www.newegg.com","SecureCOM":"secure.newegg.com","CA":"www.newegg.ca","Dynamic":"newegg.com"},"currency":{"extraUnit":"","currencyCode":"USD","countryCode":"USA","unit":"$","decimalDigits":2,"groupSizes":3,"decimalSeparator":".","groupSeparator":",","positivePattern":0,"supportDecimal":true}}</script><script defer="">window.__pageInfo__ = {"params":{"parentItem":"N82E16813128829"},"query":{"Item":"N82E16813128829","sdtid":"0","leaderboard":"1","nm_mc":"AFC-RAN-COM","cm_mmc":"AFC-RAN-COM","utm_medium":"affiliates","utm_source":"afc-Slickdeals LLC","AFFID":"208164","AFFNAME":"Slickdeals LLC","ACRID":"1","ASUBID":"717834a4134211eb97ff562d90c888120INT","ASID":"https:\u002F\u002Fslickdeals.net\u002Fdeals\u002Fpc-game\u002F","ranMID":"44583","ranEAID":"208164","ranSiteID":"lw9MynSeamY-Ca7pbJYCUVUkXYKVIxP.iQ"},"routeName":"ProductWithoutKeyword","imageName":"product"}</script><script defer="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/webResource/Scripts/WWW/vendorChunks-4bfc1d94.js"></script><script defer="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/webResource/Scripts/WWW/BatteryFinder~DIYBuilderList~DIYItemList~DIYSubcategory~InkTonerFinder~MemoryFinder~ProductDetail~Sh~b91b0c19-7b0ba42f.js"></script><script defer="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/webResource/Scripts/WWW/BatteryFinder~DIYBuilderList~DIYItemList~DIYSubcategory~InkTonerFinder~MemoryFinder~ProductDetail~Sh~c6e47e3c-7c3584af.js"></script><script defer="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/webResource/Scripts/WWW/ProductDetail-cc19aeb1.js"></script><script defer="" src="https://c1.neweggimages.com/webResource/Scripts/WWW/adapterScript-91a33117.js"></script></body></html>
