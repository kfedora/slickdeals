Depending on the nature of the Incentive, the Incentive will either appear in the referring memberâ€™s Program Account within approximately one (1) day following the Non-memberâ€™s enrollment, or will be shipped or mailed to the referring member (at the address provided in the memberâ€™s account) within two weeksâ€™ of the Non-memberâ€™s enrollment, in Aceâ€™s sole discretion. Ace reserves the right to terminate the Referral Offer at any time, with or without advance notice. (Note: Removal of the Referral Offer from the App constitutes notice of the termination of the Referral Offer). Non-members must meet all Program eligibility requirements and must complete all Program enrollment requirements in the App using the Invitation Code provided by the referring member while the Referral Offer is active in order for the referring member to receive the Incentive. If a Non-member (i) fails to provide the referring memberâ€™s Invitation Code at the time of enrollment in the Program in the App or (ii) enrolls in the Program on the Site or at a Participating Retailer, the referring member will not receive the Incentive. Ace reserves the right (in its sole discretion) to reject any Invitation Code, reject any Ace Rewards enrollment or terminate any existing Ace Rewards account (and prevent future enrollment by that person) if it suspects, in its sole discretion, that a member or Non-member involved in the use of such Invitation Code or attempted enrollment (a) has engaged in conduct to subvert the purposes of the Referral Offer, (b) has engaged or attempted to engage in fraudulent conduct to obtain an Incentive; or (c) has violated any Referral Offer or these Program Terms.  Ace may give notice of its decision to reject an Invitation Code or terminate an account to the existing member and/or the Non-member by email, at its sole discretion. The Referral Offer is subject to these Program Terms. Void where prohibited. \u003cb\u003eBy participating in this Referral Offer, you agree to Ace Rewards Terms and Conditions, which are expressly incorporated herein.  The Ace Rewards Terms and Conditions are available by request in any store, and are also available for review at: \u003ca href=\u0022https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=ace-rewards\u0022\u003ehttps://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=ace-rewards\u003c/a\u003e.

For every 2,500 Points accrued, you will receive a Reward redeemable for $5.00 off the purchase price of eligible merchandise. If you earn multiple Rewards at the same time (because you have accrued 5,000 or more Points), the Rewards may be combined into a single Reward or Ace may elect, in its sole discretion, to split the total value of the Rewards between multiple Rewards in denominations of Aceâ€™s choosing, provided that all Rewards are issued in multiples of $5.00. Ace does not issue partial or fractional Rewards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003eRewards are processed during the week in which the minimum 2,500 Point level is attained. Points are automatically deducted from your Program Account for issued Rewards. You cannot elect to retain the Points in your Program Account instead of receiving a Reward. Rewards are available in digital and print versions, as more fully described below, but digital and print versions of a Reward constitute a single Reward which may be redeemed only once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003eDigital Rewards: Program Accounts with more than 2,500 Points on Sunday will have a digital Reward (\u0022Digital Reward\u0022) issued and available for redemption on or about Monday. Redemption of Digital Rewards requires a Linked Ace Hardware Account and is not available to residents of Puerto Rico. Digital Rewards may be redeemed on the Site or in the App, or may be downloaded to your device or printed out for use at the Participating Retailer identified on the Digital Reward. In addition, Digital Rewards downloaded to your device or that you print out may be accepted by other Participating Retailers, in their sole discretion. For guidance on redeeming Digital Rewards, please review Aceâ€™s Customer Service policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003ePrint Rewards: If a Digital Reward has not been redeemed by the end of the month following the month of issuance, Ace will mail a tangible print Reward (\u0022Print Reward\u0022) to the mailing address associated with your Program Account if we have a valid mailing address for you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Your Assigned Participating Retailer (as defined below), may request that we mail your Print Rewards to such Assigned Participating Retailer instead of mailing the Print Rewards to you. If your Print Reward is mailed to Your Assigned Participating Retailer, your Digital Reward will still be available redemption (see the paragraph above on Digital  Rewards redemption) if you are a resident of the fifty United States or the District of Columbia. A Print Reward may be redeemed at the Participating Retailer identified on the Print Reward. In addition, Print Rewards may be accepted by other Participating Retailers, in their sole discretion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003eWhether redeemed in-store, on the Site, or in the App, Rewards can be applied toward the purchase of eligible merchandise only. Eligible merchandise excludes: (i) rentals; (ii) in-store services; (iii) gift cards; (iv) city stickers, trash bags, and other licenses and permits; (v) lumber and building materials; (vi) shipping, handling, assembly, and delivery; (vii) liquor, tobacco, firearms, and fuel; (viii) payments on account, including house accounts and credit cards; (ix) previously purchased merchandise; and (x) taxes. Additional exclusions may apply. See your Assigned Participating Retailer for details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003cp\u003eRewards are valid for a single transaction only. You may combine more than one Reward towards an eligible purchase and, except as otherwise prohibited, Rewards may be used in conjunction with other offers and discounts. If the value of the Reward(s) used is greater than the purchase price of eligible merchandise, before tax, no change will be given and the remaining balance of the Reward(s) will be forfeited. Photocopies, duplicates, and facsimiles of Print Rewards are not valid. Rewards are allocated pro rata across all eligible merchandise and will not be replaced if eligible merchandise is returned. Rewards can be used until their expiration date, unless sooner redeemed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n    \u003ch4\u003eAdditional Benefits\u003c/h4\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eAce, in its sole discretion, may offer additional benefits to Program members from time to time.

Existing Program members who elect to participate in a Referral Offer will be assigned a unique invitation code (\u0022Invitation Code\u0022) to share with friends and family who are not already Ace Rewards members (\u0022Non-members\u0022). When members share their Invitation Code with an eligible Non-member and the eligible Non-member enrolls in the Program in the App while the Offer is still open and active, the referring member will earn one thousand (1,000) points (\u0022Referral Bonus Point Incentive\u0022) or such other incentive that Ace has announced as the incentive at the time that particular Invitation Code was issued (the \u0022Current Incentive\u0022).  Referral Bonus Points Incentive and Current Incentive may be referred to interchangeably herein as the \u0022Incentive.\u0022  Limit one Incentive per Referral Offer.  If there is any reasonable question as to what Incentive was being offered by Ace at the time an Invitation Code was issued, Ace shall resolve the dispute in its sole discretion. Depending on the nature of the Incentive, the Incentive will either appear in the referring member\u0027s Program Account within approximately one (1) day following the Non-member\u0027s enrollment, or will be shipped or mailed to the referring member (at the address provided in the member\u0027s account) within two weeks\u0027 of the Non-member\u0027s enrollment, in Ace\u0027s sole discretion. Ace reserves the right to terminate the Referral Offer at any time, with or without advance notice. (Note: Removal of the Referral Offer from the App constitutes notice of the termination of the Referral Offer). Non-members must meet all Program eligibility requirements and must complete all Program enrollment requirements in the App using the Invitation Code provided by the referring member while the Referral Offer is active in order for the referring member to receive the Incentive. If a Non-member (i) fails to provide the referring member\u0027s Invitation Code at the time of enrollment in the Program in the App or (ii) enrolls in the Program on the Site or at a Participating Retailer, the referring member will not receive the Incentive. Ace reserves the right (in its sole discretion) to reject any Invitation Code, reject any Ace Rewards enrollment or terminate any existing Ace Rewards account (and prevent future enrollment by that person) if it suspects, in its sole discretion, that a member or Non-member involved in the use of such Invitation Code or attempted enrollment (a) has engaged in conduct to subvert the purposes of the Referral Offer, (b) has engaged or attempted to engage in fraudulent conduct to obtain an Incentive; or (c) has violated any Referral Offer or these Program Terms.  Ace may give notice of its decision to reject an Invitation Code or terminate an account to the existing member and/or the Non-member by email, at its sole discretion. The Referral Offer is subject to these Program Terms. Void where prohibited. \u003cb\u003eBy participating in this Referral Offer, you agree to Ace Rewards Terms and Conditions, which are expressly incorporated herein.

For every 2,500 Points accrued, you will receive a Reward redeemable for $5.00 off the purchase price of eligible merchandise. If you earn multiple Rewards at the same time (because you have accrued 5,000 or more Points), the Rewards may be combined into a single Reward or Ace may elect, in its sole discretion, to split the total value of the Rewards between multiple Rewards in denominations of Ace\u0027s choosing, provided that all Rewards are issued in multiples of $5.00. Ace does not issue partial or fractional Rewards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\u003cp\u003eRewards are processed during the week in which the minimum 2,500 Point level is attained. Points are automatically deducted from your Program Account for issued Rewards. You cannot elect to retain the Points in your Program Account instead of receiving a Reward.

Redemption of Digital Rewards requires a Linked Ace Hardware Account and is not available to residents of Puerto Rico. Digital Rewards may be redeemed on the Site or in the App, or may be downloaded to your device or printed out for use at the Participating Retailer identified on the Digital Reward. In addition, Digital Rewards downloaded to your device or that you print out may be accepted by other Participating Retailers, in their sole discretion.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Your Assigned Participating Retailer (as defined below), may request that we mail your Print Rewards to such Assigned Participating Retailer instead of mailing the Print Rewards to you. If your Print Reward is mailed to Your Assigned Participating Retailer, your Digital Reward will still be available redemption (see the paragraph above on Digital  Rewards redemption) if you are a resident of the fifty United States or the District of Columbia. A Print Reward may be redeemed at the Participating Retailer identified on the Print Reward. In addition, Print Rewards may be accepted by other Participating Retailers, in their sole discretion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\u003cp\u003eWhether redeemed in-store, on the Site, or in the App, Rewards can be applied toward the purchase of eligible merchandise only.

Additional exclusions may apply. See your Assigned Participating Retailer for details.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\u003cp\u003eRewards are valid for a single transaction only. You may combine more than one Reward towards an eligible purchase and, except as otherwise prohibited, Rewards may be used in conjunction with other offers and discounts. If the value of the Reward(s) used is greater than the purchase price of eligible merchandise, before tax, no change will be given and the remaining balance of the Reward(s) will be forfeited. Photocopies, duplicates, and facsimiles of Print Rewards are not valid. Rewards are allocated pro rata across all eligible merchandise and will not be replaced if eligible merchandise is returned.

acehardware.com/frequent-buyer-savings (the \u0022Frequent Buyer Website\u0022).

Each individual purchase of a product that makes up the Offer shall be referred to as a \u0022Qualifying Purchase\u0022 and completing all of the Qualifying Purchases to fulfill the Offer shall be referred to as meeting the \u0022Purchase Requirements.\u0022 If the Eligible Customer completes the Purchase Requirements of the Offer during the Offer Period, the Eligible Customer will be entitled to receive the incentive from a Pilot Program Participating Location (while supplies last), which will also be identified within the Offer Terms (the \u0022Incentive\u0022). Many Offers involve multiple purchases of products before the Participating Customer will earn the Incentive. Unless otherwise stated in the Offer Terms, the purchases do not have to be completed in a single transaction, but all required purchases do have to be completed during the Offer Period at a Pilot Program Participating Location. Once the final purchase of the Purchase Requirements of the Offer is completed, the Eligible Customer will have until the Offer End Date to claim the Incentive. Eligible Customers must check out at register with the Incentive item at a Pilot Program Participating Location and may be responsible for payment of applicable tax on the Incentive.

During the Offer Period, if an Eligible Customer makes purchases at a Pilot Program Participating Location but those purchases do not include any Qualifying Purchases from an active Offer, there will be no messaging about that Offer on the Eligible Customer\u0027s receipt (even if the Eligible Customer has previously made purchases toward that Offer). Eligible Customers should save their receipts when a Qualifying Purchase is made as there is not a method by which Eligible Customers can look up the status of their Qualifying Purchases toward Offers. However, Eligible Customers may find out their status by calling the Care Center at 888-827-4223.

YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\u0022AAA\u0022) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA\u0027s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA\u0027s Rules and a form for initiating arbitration proceedings are available on the AAA\u0027s website at:  www.adr.org.

Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party\u0027s individual claim(s).

In addition, if you are enrolling on behalf of a business entity, you are certifying that you are authorized to bind, and do hereby bind, the business entity to these Terms.</p><h4>Enrollment</h4><p>There is no charge to enroll and participate in the Program.</p><p>You can enroll in the Program: (i) in store, by completing a Program enrollment form at an Ace Hardware retail location that participates in the Program ("Participating Retailer"); or (ii) online, by completing the Program enrollment process at: [insert URL]. Online Program enrollment requires a pre-existing Ace Hardware online account ("Ace Hardware Account"). If you don't have an Ace Hardware Account, you can open one by completing the Ace Hardware Account enrollment process at: [insert URL]. Online Program enrollment is not available to residents of Puerto Rico. All required information must be provided, including full name, business name (if applicable), mailing address, and phone number. Additional required information may be identified during the enrollment process. Upon successful completion of Program enrollment, a Program account will be created ("Program Account") and you will become a Program member. Each Program member is limited to a single Program Account and duplicate Program Accounts may be terminated. Only Program members in good standing can accrue Points, earn or redeem Rewards, and otherwise participate in the Program.</p><p>For information on Participating Retailers near you, please contact <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=contact-us">Customer Service</a>. </p><h4>Program Cards</h4><p>Ace may elect to provide you with a Program membership card ("Program Card"), which may include a key chain card, but a Program Card is not necessary to participate in the Program or take advantage of Program benefits. If you enroll at a Participating Retailer, one or more Program Cards may be provided to you at that time. If you enroll online, one or more Program Cards may be mailed to the mailing address associated with your Program Account.</p><p>Program Cards are and shall at all times remain Ace's property. You agree to surrender your Program Card to us upon our request. You are responsible for all transactions using your Program Card and/or Program Account and agree to notify us immediately if your Program Card is lost or stolen or if you become aware of any unauthorized activity related to your Program Account. If you would like to replace your Program Card or would like additional Program Cards, please contact <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=contact-us">Customer Service</a>.</p><h4>Accruing Points</h4><p>Members earn Program points ("Points") by making qualifying purchases on the Site, via the App, or at Participating Retailers. Ten (10) Points will accrue for every $1.00 spent on qualifying purchases, less any discount, coupon, Instant Savings, Red Hot Buy, Reward redemption, in-store promotion or any other price adjustment made at time of purchase. Points will not accrue and may be deducted for any returns, credits, refunds, chargebacks, or voided transactions.</p><p>Qualifying purchases exclude: (i) taxes; (ii) gift cards; (iii) charitable donations; (iv) service fees; (v) any merchandise purchased from a Participating Retailerâ€™s non-Ace businesses; (vi) any merchandise that a Participating Retailer, in its sole discretion, elects to exclude from time to time; (vii) any merchandise that Ace, in its sole discretion, elects to exclude from time to time; (viii) any non-merchandise, such as services (including shipping, handling, assembly, and delivery charges); (ix) payments on accounts, credit card payments, finance and interest charges, and late fees; (x) any purchase made on any website or application other than the Site or the App; (xi) purchases at retailers that donâ€™t participate in the Program; (xii) city stickers, trash bags, and other licenses and permits; and (xiii) any purchase required to be excluded by applicable law.</p><p>Points will not be awarded retroactively. To earn Points for qualifying purchases at a Participating Retailer, you must present your Program Card or the phone number associated with your Program Account at the time of purchase. Your Program Account number may appear at the bottom of the store receipt. However, the presence of your Program Account number on the receipt does not mean all items, or any items, appearing on the receipt were qualifying purchases. To earn Points for qualifying purchases on the Site or in the App, you must have an Ace Hardware Account linked to your Program Account ("Linked Ace Hardware Account") at the time of purchase.</p><p>In addition, from time to time Ace may elect to award Points in connection with special offers or promotions, including the Ace Rewards Referral Friend Bonus Points Offer described below. Such Points are offered or awarded in Aceâ€™s sole discretion, may not be offered or awarded to all Program members, and are subject to the terms of the Special Offer. See each special offer or promotion for any specific terms, limitations, restrictions, or exclusions, including expiration dates.</p><p>Points for qualifying purchases will typically appear in your account within five (5) business days of your qualifying purchase. Points earned in connection with special offers or promotions will typically appear within the timeframe identified in the applicable offer or promotion. If you feel Points were not properly credited to your Program Account, you must notify us by calling <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=contact-us">Customer Service</a> within thirty (30) days of (i) the date on which the qualifying purchase took place, or (ii) with respect to Points earned in connection with special offers or promotions, the date on which such Points should have been awarded per the terms of the applicable offer or promotion. You agree that our determination with respect to Points accrued shall be final. Points reflected in our records shall be deemed correct and we shall have the right to determine the Points to be awarded to you, consistent with these Program Terms, and to adjust or void Points at any time.</p><h4>Ace Rewards Referral Friend Offer</h4><p>From time to time, Ace may offer existing Program members the opportunity to participate in an Ace Rewards Referral Friend Offer (each a "Referral Offer") in the App.  Members (whether under the same or a different account) may only participate in a maximum of one hundred (100) Referral Offers, regardless of the Incentive (as defined below) being offered.  Existing Program members who elect to participate in a Referral Offer will be assigned a unique invitation code ("Invitation Code") to share with friends and family who are not already Ace Rewards members ("Non-members"). When members share their Invitation Code with an eligible Non-member and the eligible Non-member enrolls in the Program in the App while the Offer is still open and active, the referring member will earn one thousand (1,000) points ("Referral Bonus Point Incentive") or such other incentive that Ace has announced as the incentive at the time that particular Invitation Code was issued (the "Current Incentive").  Referral Bonus Points Incentive and Current Incentive may be referred to interchangeably herein as the "Incentive."  Limit one Incentive per Referral Offer.  If there is any reasonable question as to what Incentive was being offered by Ace at the time an Invitation Code was issued, Ace shall resolve the dispute in its sole discretion. Depending on the nature of the Incentive, the Incentive will either appear in the referring memberâ€™s Program Account within approximately one (1) day following the Non-memberâ€™s enrollment, or will be shipped or mailed to the referring member (at the address provided in the memberâ€™s account) within two weeksâ€™ of the Non-memberâ€™s enrollment, in Aceâ€™s sole discretion. Ace reserves the right to terminate the Referral Offer at any time, with or without advance notice. (Note: Removal of the Referral Offer from the App constitutes notice of the termination of the Referral Offer). Non-members must meet all Program eligibility requirements and must complete all Program enrollment requirements in the App using the Invitation Code provided by the referring member while the Referral Offer is active in order for the referring member to receive the Incentive. If a Non-member (i) fails to provide the referring memberâ€™s Invitation Code at the time of enrollment in the Program in the App or (ii) enrolls in the Program on the Site or at a Participating Retailer, the referring member will not receive the Incentive. Ace reserves the right (in its sole discretion) to reject any Invitation Code, reject any Ace Rewards enrollment or terminate any existing Ace Rewards account (and prevent future enrollment by that person) if it suspects, in its sole discretion, that a member or Non-member involved in the use of such Invitation Code or attempted enrollment (a) has engaged in conduct to subvert the purposes of the Referral Offer, (b) has engaged or attempted to engage in fraudulent conduct to obtain an Incentive; or (c) has violated any Referral Offer or these Program Terms.  Ace may give notice of its decision to reject an Invitation Code or terminate an account to the existing member and/or the Non-member by email, at its sole discretion. The Referral Offer is subject to these Program Terms. Void where prohibited. <b>By participating in this Referral Offer, you agree to Ace Rewards Terms and Conditions, which are expressly incorporated herein.  The Ace Rewards Terms and Conditions are available by request in any store, and are also available for review at: <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=ace-rewards">https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=ace-rewards</a>.  The Ace Rewards Terms and Conditions are subject to change.</b></p><h4>Earning and Redeeming Rewards</h4><p>You must earn at least 2,500 Points to receive a Program reward ("Reward"). For every 2,500 Points accrued, you will receive a Reward redeemable for $5.00 off the purchase price of eligible merchandise. If you earn multiple Rewards at the same time (because you have accrued 5,000 or more Points), the Rewards may be combined into a single Reward or Ace may elect, in its sole discretion, to split the total value of the Rewards between multiple Rewards in denominations of Aceâ€™s choosing, provided that all Rewards are issued in multiples of $5.00. Ace does not issue partial or fractional Rewards.</p><p>Rewards are processed during the week in which the minimum 2,500 Point level is attained. Points are automatically deducted from your Program Account for issued Rewards. You cannot elect to retain the Points in your Program Account instead of receiving a Reward. Rewards are available in digital and print versions, as more fully described below, but digital and print versions of a Reward constitute a single Reward which may be redeemed only once.</p><p>Digital Rewards: Program Accounts with more than 2,500 Points on Sunday will have a digital Reward ("Digital Reward") issued and available for redemption on or about Monday. Redemption of Digital Rewards requires a Linked Ace Hardware Account and is not available to residents of Puerto Rico. Digital Rewards may be redeemed on the Site or in the App, or may be downloaded to your device or printed out for use at the Participating Retailer identified on the Digital Reward. In addition, Digital Rewards downloaded to your device or that you print out may be accepted by other Participating Retailers, in their sole discretion. For guidance on redeeming Digital Rewards, please review Aceâ€™s Customer Service policies.</p><p>Print Rewards: If a Digital Reward has not been redeemed by the end of the month following the month of issuance, Ace will mail a tangible print Reward ("Print Reward") to the mailing address associated with your Program Account if we have a valid mailing address for you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Your Assigned Participating Retailer (as defined below), may request that we mail your Print Rewards to such Assigned Participating Retailer instead of mailing the Print Rewards to you. If your Print Reward is mailed to Your Assigned Participating Retailer, your Digital Reward will still be available redemption (see the paragraph above on Digital  Rewards redemption) if you are a resident of the fifty United States or the District of Columbia. A Print Reward may be redeemed at the Participating Retailer identified on the Print Reward. In addition, Print Rewards may be accepted by other Participating Retailers, in their sole discretion.</p><p>Whether redeemed in-store, on the Site, or in the App, Rewards can be applied toward the purchase of eligible merchandise only. Eligible merchandise excludes: (i) rentals; (ii) in-store services; (iii) gift cards; (iv) city stickers, trash bags, and other licenses and permits; (v) lumber and building materials; (vi) shipping, handling, assembly, and delivery; (vii) liquor, tobacco, firearms, and fuel; (viii) payments on account, including house accounts and credit cards; (ix) previously purchased merchandise; and (x) taxes. Additional exclusions may apply. See your Assigned Participating Retailer for details.</p><p>Rewards are valid for a single transaction only. You may combine more than one Reward towards an eligible purchase and, except as otherwise prohibited, Rewards may be used in conjunction with other offers and discounts. If the value of the Reward(s) used is greater than the purchase price of eligible merchandise, before tax, no change will be given and the remaining balance of the Reward(s) will be forfeited. Photocopies, duplicates, and facsimiles of Print Rewards are not valid. Rewards are allocated pro rata across all eligible merchandise and will not be replaced if eligible merchandise is returned. Rewards can be used until their expiration date, unless sooner redeemed.</p><h4>Additional Benefits</h4><p>Ace, in its sole discretion, may offer additional benefits to Program members from time to time. These additional benefits may include:</p><ul><li>Offers and coupons exclusively for members</li><li>Instant savings in-store, on the Site, and/or in the App</li></ul><p>Proof of Program membership may be required to take advantage of Program Benefits.</p><h4>Ace Rewards Premier</h4><p>Ace Rewards Premier Eligibility and Expiration: Ace Rewards Premier status is available only to Ace Rewards Program members in good standing. Program members who spend $750 or more in any twelve (12) month period while an Ace Rewards Program member are automatically eligible for Ace Rewards Premier status; provided that corporate/business Program members and Program members with store house accounts are ineligible for Ace Rewards Premier status. Program members for whom we have a valid mailing address will be informed by mail approximately one to two months following the end of the calendar quarter during which they became eligible for Ace Rewards Premier. Information regarding eligibility for Ace Rewards Premier status is available in the App or by contacting <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=contact-us">Customer Service</a>. Ace Rewards Premier status expires one (1) year from the end of the calendar quarter in which you qualify for Ace Rewards Premier status. Upon expiration of the one-year period, Program members may requalify for Ace Rewards Premier status for subsequent one-year terms if they continue to meet the Ace Rewards Premier eligibility criteria.</p><p>Ace Rewards Premier Benefits: Program members with Ace Rewards Premier status and for whom we have a valid mailing address will be mailed special printed offers and coupons (collectively, "Ace Rewards Premier Coupons"). Ace Rewards Premier Coupons are redeemable at the Participating Retailer identified on the Ace Rewards Premier Coupon and may be accepted by other Participating Retailers, in their sole discretion. Ace, in its sole discretion, determines the nature, amount, and frequency of Ace Rewards Premier Coupons, which Ace may change from time to time with or without notice to you. Not all Ace Rewards Premier Coupons may be made available to all Ace Rewards Premier members. See each Ace Rewards Premier Coupon for any specific terms, limitations, restrictions, and/or exclusions, including expiration dates.</p><h4>Expiration</h4><p>REWARDS WILL ISSUE AND EXPIRE ACCORDING TO THESE PROGRAM TERMS, SO KEEP YOUR MAILING ADDRESS AND OTHER PROGRAM ACCOUNT INFORMATION CURRENT TO ENSURE YOU RECEIVE REWARDS AND OTHER PROGRAM BENEFITS.</p><p>Points:  Points do not expire and unused Points will remain in your Program Account until you reach the minimum number of Points needed to receive a Reward. </p><p>Rewards:  Rewards expire on the last day of the fourth month following the month in which they are processed. For example, if you have accrued a total of 2,500 points in January, your Reward will be processed at the end of January and will expire on May 31. The expiration date will be printed on your Printed Reward. You can also obtain information regarding Reward expiration dates through your Linked Ace Hardware Account.</p><p>Ace Rewards Premier: Ace Rewards Premier status will expire as described in the Ace Rewards Premier section above. Ace Rewards Premier Coupons will expire on the date printed on the coupon. </p><h4>Additional Exclusions and Limitations</h4><p>In addition to any exclusions, conditions, and limitations specified in these Program Terms, all Digital Rewards, Print Rewards, Ace Rewards Premier Coupons, offers, coupons, promotions, and other Program benefits (collectively, "Program Benefits") are subject to availability and to the terms of the Program Benefit. See each Reward, offer, coupon, promotion or other Program Benefit for any specific terms, limitations, restrictions, or exclusions, including expiration dates. Program Benefits are void where prohibited.</p><p>Participating Retailers may alter the Program and the Program Benefits at their discretion. Please consult the Participating Retailer for details.</p><h4>Value and Transfer</h4><p>Points, Rewards, Ace Rewards Premier Coupons, and other Program Benefits: (i) have no cash value; (ii) cannot be exchanged for cash, in whole or in part; and (iii) have no value outside of the Program. At our discretion we may, but are not obligated to, replace unredeemed lost or stolen Print Rewards that have not expired. The accumulation of Points does not entitle you to any vested rights with respect to Points, Rewards, or any other Program Benefits.</p><p>A memberâ€™s Program membership, Program Account, Program Card, Points, Rewards, Ace Rewards Premier Coupons, special offers, and all other Program Benefits or awards are for the use of the named Program member only and cannot be sold, shared, assigned, bartered, or otherwise transferred. In the event of a divorce of a Program member, the named Program member retains all Points and Rewards unless otherwise provided by a valid and final court order submitted to Ace. In the event of the death of a Program member, except as otherwise required by law, all Points and Rewards remain non-transferable.</p><h4>Assigned Participating Retailer</h4><p>If you enroll in the Program on the Site or via the App, Ace will assign a Participating Retailer to you based on the mailing address associated with your Program Account ("Assigned Participating Retailer"). If you enroll in the Program at a Participating Retailer, that Participating Retailer will be your Assigned Participating Retailer. From time to time Ace may change your Assigned Participating Retailer based on your shopping habits or other factors. In addition, you may contact <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=contact-us">Customer Service</a> to request a change in your Assigned Participating Retailer, but any such change will be effective for future Rewards and other Program Benefits only and not Rewards or other Program Benefits that have already been processed.</p><h4>Program Accounts; Program Account Termination</h4><p>You are solely responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the information you supply in connection with your Program Account. Failure to keep your Program Account information current and complete may result in forfeiture or lapsing of Points, Rewards, Ace Rewards Premier status, Ace Rewards Premier Coupons, special offers, and other Program Benefits. You may access and update your information and access your Program Account status, including Points accrued, by contacting <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=contact-us">Customer Service</a>. You can also access and update your Program Account online by logging into your Linked Ace Hardware Account on the Site. You may also update some Program Account information in the App. Please note that residents of Puerto Rico will not be able to manage Program Accounts via the Site or App.</p><p>You may terminate your Program Account at any time by contacting <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=contact-us">Customer Service</a>. Ace may terminate your Program Account and your participation in the Program at any time, with or without notice to you and without liability or obligation to you, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that (i) you are ineligible for the Program; (ii) you have violated these Program Terms or the Terms of Use; (iii) you have engaged in illegal or fraudulent conduct or conduct that is dangerous, deceptive, improper, or objectionable; or (iv) it is advisable to protect the interests of Ace, our retailers, employees, customers, Program members, or any third party. </p><p>In the event we cancel the Program, your Program Account will automatically terminate upon the effective date of Program cancellation.</p><p>Upon termination of your Program Account for any reason, your membership in the Program terminates and all Points are voided. However, unless your Program Account was terminated due to fraud or other misconduct, Rewards issued prior to termination of your Program Account will remain valid through the applicable expiration date.</p><h4>Errors and Misconduct</h4><p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust, postpone, or void your Program Benefits, including Points and Rewards, or revoke or cancel your Ace Rewards Premier status at any time without notice, in the event of actual or suspected (i) human or technical errors; (ii) technical disruptions; (iii) misconduct, fraud, or other activity that impairs the administration, security, integrity, or proper use of the Program, any Program Benefits, or any property of Ace or Participating Retailers. In addition, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust, postpone, or void your Program Benefits, including Points and Rewards, or revoke or cancel your Ace Rewards Premier status at any time without notice for any other reason we deem appropriate.</p><h4>Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability</h4><p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PROGRAM AND ALL RELATED PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND PROGRAM BENEFITS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</p><p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ACE, ITS AFFILIATES, ITS RETAILERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, MEMBERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND VENDORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY THEORY OF LAW OR EQUITY, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM THE PROGRAM OR YOUR USE OF THE PROGRAM OR ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, OR PROGRAM BENEFITS RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT, THIRD PARTY, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY.</p><h4>Arbitration Agreement</h4><p class="bold">YOU AND ACE AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE AT LAW OR EQUITY THAT HAS ARISEN OR MAY ARISE BETWEEN US IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM WILL BE RESOLVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL IMPACT HOW CLAIMS YOU AND ACE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.</p><p>You and Ace agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Ace in connection with the Program shall be resolved exclusively through confidential, final, and binding arbitration. <span class="bold">YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.</span> The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate.

These Ace Rewards Program Terms and Conditions ("Program Terms") govern the Ace Rewards Program (the "Program") and your participation in the Program. These Program Terms constitute a binding agreement between you and Ace Hardware Corporation ("Ace" OR "we" OR "us"). PLEASE READ THESE PROGRAM TERMS BEFORE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM, AS THEY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS AND INCLUDE A BINDING CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION CLAUSE, A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ACTIONS, AND A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. BY ENROLLING OR PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE PROGRAM TERMS. If you do not agree to these Program Terms, then you should not enroll or otherwise participate in the Program. </p><h4>Privacy and Additional Terms</h4><p>Ace's use of your information is governed by our <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which is incorporated by reference into these Program Terms. In addition, your use of our Online Services as defined in Ace Hardware's Terms of Use, including the www.acehardware.com website (the "Site") and the Ace Hardware Mobile App (the "App") in connection with the Program is subject to such <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>, which are incorporated by reference into these Program Terms. To the extent of any conflict between the Privacy Policy and these Program Terms or the Terms of Use and these Program Terms, these Program Terms will prevail.</p><h4>Modification and Cancellation</h4><p>We reserve the right to alter, limit, modify, restrict, or cancel the Program, the Program conditions, the Program Benefits (as defined below), or any portion thereof and/or to modify these Program Terms (and any customer service policies or other documents related to the Program) at any time in our sole discretion with or without notice to you. Modified versions of the Program Terms will be posted at <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/rewards-terms-and-conditions">www.acehardware.com/rewards-terms-and-conditions</a> (or any other URL Ace may provide from time to time), together with a revised "Last updated" date. Although we may elect to send a mail or email communication notifying Program members of the modifications, we are not obligated to do so and you hereby waive any right you may have to receive such notice. You should check this page periodically to see if any recent changes to the Program Terms have occurred. By participating in the Program after we post any such changes, you agree to the Program Terms as modified.</p><h4>Eligibility</h4><p>To be eligible for Program membership, you must: (i) be an individual at least 18 years of age; (ii) a resident of the fifty (50) United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; and (iii) provide all required enrollment information. Except as otherwise provided in these Program Terms, business entities are eligible to participate in the Program, provided an authorized employee completes the enrollment process. Ace Hardware retailers may exclude their employees from participating in the Program.</p><p>By enrolling in the Program, you are certifying that you meet all eligibility criteria. In addition, if you are enrolling on behalf of a business entity, you are certifying that you are authorized to bind, and do hereby bind, the business entity to these Terms.</p><h4>Enrollment</h4><p>There is no charge to enroll and participate in the Program.</p><p>You can enroll in the Program: (i) in store, by completing a Program enrollment form at an Ace Hardware retail location that participates in the Program ("Participating Retailer"); (ii) by completing the Program enrollment process via the App, which is available for download at the Apple&reg; App Store for iOS devices and the Google Play&trade; store for Android&trade; devices; or (iii) by completing the Program enrollment process on the Site at: <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/ace-rewards">https://www.acehardware.com/ace-rewards</a>. Program enrollment in the App or on the Site requires a pre-existing Ace Hardware online account ("Ace Hardware Account"). If you don't have an Ace Hardware Account, you can open one by completing the Ace Hardware Account enrollment process in the App or on the Site at: <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/ace-rewards">https://www.acehardware.com/ace-rewards</a> Program enrollment via the Online Services is not available to residents of Puerto Rico, who must enroll at a Participating Retailer. All required information must be provided, including full name, business name (if applicable), mailing address, and phone number. Additional required information may be identified during the enrollment process. Upon successful completion of Program enrollment, a Program account will be created ("Program Account") and you will become a Program member. Each Program member is limited to a single Program Account and Ace may elect to terminate duplicate Program Accounts. Only Program members in good standing can participate in the Program.</p><p>For information on Participating Retailers near you, please contact <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=contact-us">Customer Service</a>. </p><h4>Program Cards</h4><p>Ace may elect to provide you with a Program membership card ("Program Card"), but a Program Card is not necessary to participate in the Program or take advantage of Program Benefits. If you enroll at a Participating Retailer, one or more Program Cards may be provided to you at that time. If you enroll in the App or on the Site, one or more Program Cards may be mailed to the mailing address associated with your Program Account.</p><p>Program Cards are and shall at all times remain Ace's property. You agree to surrender your Program Card to us upon our request. You are responsible for all transactions using your Program Card and/or Program Account and agree to notify us immediately if your Program Card is lost or stolen or if you become aware of any unauthorized activity related to your Program Account. If you would like to replace your Program Card or would like additional Program Cards, please contact <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=contact-us">Customer Service</a>.</p><h4>Accruing Points</h4><p>Members earn Program points ("Points") by making qualifying purchases on the Site, via the App, or at Participating Retailers. Ten (10) Points will accrue for every $1.00 spent on qualifying purchases, less any discount, coupon, Instant Savings, Red Hot Buy, Reward redemption, in-store promotion or any other price adjustment made at time of purchase. Points will not accrue and may be deducted for any returns, credits, refunds, chargebacks, or voided transactions.</p><p>Qualifying purchases exclude: (i) taxes; (ii) gift cards; (iii) charitable donations; (iv) service fees; (v) any merchandise purchased from a Participating Retailer's non-Ace businesses; (vi) any merchandise that a Participating Retailer, in its sole discretion, elects to exclude from time to time; (vii) any merchandise that Ace, in its sole discretion, elects to exclude from time to time; (viii) any non-merchandise, such as services (including shipping, handling, assembly, and delivery charges); (ix) payments on accounts, credit card payments, finance and interest charges, and late fees; (x) any purchase made on any website or application other than the Site or the App; (xi) purchases at retailers that don't participate in the Program; (xii) city stickers, trash bags, and other licenses and permits; and (xiii) any purchase required to be excluded by applicable law.</p><p>Points will not be awarded retroactively. To earn Points for qualifying purchases at a Participating Retailer, you must present your Program Card or the phone number associated with your Program Account at the time of purchase. Your Program Account number may appear at the bottom of the store receipt. However, the presence of your Program Account number on the receipt does not mean all items, or any items, appearing on the receipt were qualifying purchases. To earn Points for qualifying purchases on the Site or in the App, you must have an Ace Hardware Account linked to your Program Account ("Linked Ace Hardware Account") at the time of purchase.</p><p>In addition, from time to time Ace may elect to award Points in connection with special offers or promotions, including the Ace Rewards Referral Friend Bonus Points Offer described below. Such Points are offered or awarded in Ace's sole discretion, may not be offered or awarded to all Program members, and are subject to the terms of the Special Offer. See each special offer or promotion for any specific terms, limitations, restrictions, or exclusions, including expiration dates.</p><p>Points for qualifying purchases will typically appear in your account within five (5) business days of your qualifying purchase. Points earned in connection with special offers or promotions will typically appear within the timeframe identified in the applicable offer or promotion. If you feel Points were not properly credited to your Program Account, you must notify us by calling <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=contact-us">Customer Service</a> within thirty (30) days of (i) the date on which the qualifying purchase took place, or (ii) with respect to Points earned in connection with special offers or promotions, the date on which such Points should have been awarded per the terms of the applicable offer or promotion. You agree that our determination with respect to Points accrued shall be final. Points reflected in our records shall be deemed correct and we shall have the right to determine the Points to be awarded to you, consistent with these Program Terms, and to adjust or void Points at any time.</p><h4>Ace Rewards Referral Friend Offer</h4><p>From time to time, Ace may offer existing Program members the opportunity to participate in an Ace Rewards Referral Friend Offer (each a "Referral Offer") in the App.  Members (whether under the same or a different account) may only participate in a maximum of one hundred (100) Referral Offers, regardless of the Incentive (as defined below) being offered.  Existing Program members who elect to participate in a Referral Offer will be assigned a unique invitation code ("Invitation Code") to share with friends and family who are not already Ace Rewards members ("Non-members"). When members share their Invitation Code with an eligible Non-member and the eligible Non-member enrolls in the Program in the App while the Offer is still open and active, the referring member will earn one thousand (1,000) points ("Referral Bonus Point Incentive") or such other incentive that Ace has announced as the incentive at the time that particular Invitation Code was issued (the "Current Incentive").  Referral Bonus Points Incentive and Current Incentive may be referred to interchangeably herein as the "Incentive."  Limit one Incentive per Referral Offer.  If there is any reasonable question as to what Incentive was being offered by Ace at the time an Invitation Code was issued, Ace shall resolve the dispute in its sole discretion. Depending on the nature of the Incentive, the Incentive will either appear in the referring member's Program Account within approximately one (1) day following the Non-member's enrollment, or will be shipped or mailed to the referring member (at the address provided in the member's account) within two weeks' of the Non-member's enrollment, in Ace's sole discretion. Ace reserves the right to terminate the Referral Offer at any time, with or without advance notice. (Note: Removal of the Referral Offer from the App constitutes notice of the termination of the Referral Offer). Non-members must meet all Program eligibility requirements and must complete all Program enrollment requirements in the App using the Invitation Code provided by the referring member while the Referral Offer is active in order for the referring member to receive the Incentive. If a Non-member (i) fails to provide the referring member's Invitation Code at the time of enrollment in the Program in the App or (ii) enrolls in the Program on the Site or at a Participating Retailer, the referring member will not receive the Incentive. Ace reserves the right (in its sole discretion) to reject any Invitation Code, reject any Ace Rewards enrollment or terminate any existing Ace Rewards account (and prevent future enrollment by that person) if it suspects, in its sole discretion, that a member or Non-member involved in the use of such Invitation Code or attempted enrollment (a) has engaged in conduct to subvert the purposes of the Referral Offer, (b) has engaged or attempted to engage in fraudulent conduct to obtain an Incentive; or (c) has violated any Referral Offer or these Program Terms.  Ace may give notice of its decision to reject an Invitation Code or terminate an account to the existing member and/or the Non-member by email, at its sole discretion. The Referral Offer is subject to these Program Terms. Void where prohibited. <b>By participating in this Referral Offer, you agree to Ace Rewards Terms and Conditions, which are expressly incorporated herein.  The Ace Rewards Terms and Conditions are available by request in any store, and are also available for review at: <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=ace-rewards">https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=ace-rewards</a>.  The Ace Rewards Terms and Conditions are subject to change.</b></p><h4>Earning and Redeeming Rewards</h4><p>You must earn at least 2,500 Points to receive a Program reward ("Reward"). For every 2,500 Points accrued, you will receive a Reward redeemable for $5.00 off the purchase price of eligible merchandise. If you earn multiple Rewards at the same time (because you have accrued 5,000 or more Points), the Rewards may be combined into a single Reward or Ace may elect, in its sole discretion, to split the total value of the Rewards between multiple Rewards in denominations of Ace's choosing, provided that all Rewards are issued in multiples of $5.00. Ace does not issue partial or fractional Rewards.</p><p>Rewards are processed during the week in which the minimum 2,500 Point level is attained. Points are automatically deducted from your Program Account for issued Rewards. You cannot elect to retain the Points in your Program Account instead of receiving a Reward. Rewards are available in digital and print versions, as more fully described below, but digital and print versions of a Reward constitute a single Reward which may be redeemed only once.</p><p>Digital Rewards: Program Accounts with more than 2,500 Points on Sunday will have a digital Reward ("Digital Reward") issued and available for redemption on or about Monday. Redemption of Digital Rewards requires a Linked Ace Hardware Account and is not available to residents of Puerto Rico. Digital Rewards may be redeemed on the Site or in the App, or may be downloaded to your device or printed out for use at the Participating Retailer identified on the Digital Reward. In addition, Digital Rewards downloaded to your device or that you print out may be accepted by other Participating Retailers, in their sole discretion. For guidance on redeeming Digital Rewards, please review Ace's <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=redeeming-rewards">Customer Service</a> policies.</p><p>Print Rewards: If a Digital Reward has not been redeemed by the end of the month following the month of issuance, Ace will mail a tangible print Reward ("Print Reward") to the mailing address associated with your Program Account if we have a valid mailing address for you. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Your Assigned Participating Retailer (as defined below), may request that we mail your Print Rewards to such Assigned Participating Retailer instead of mailing the Print Rewards to you. If your Print Reward is mailed to Your Assigned Participating Retailer, your Digital Reward will still be available redemption (see the paragraph above on Digital  Rewards redemption) if you are a resident of the fifty United States or the District of Columbia. A Print Reward may be redeemed at the Participating Retailer identified on the Print Reward. In addition, Print Rewards may be accepted by other Participating Retailers, in their sole discretion.</p><p>Whether redeemed in-store, on the Site, or in the App, Rewards can be applied toward the purchase of eligible merchandise only. Eligible merchandise excludes: (i) rentals; (ii) in-store services; (iii) gift cards; (iv) city stickers, trash bags, and other licenses and permits; (v) lumber and building materials; (vi) shipping, handling, assembly, and delivery; (vii) liquor, tobacco, firearms, and fuel; (viii) payments on account, including house accounts and credit cards; (ix) previously purchased merchandise; and (x) taxes. Additional exclusions may apply. See your Assigned Participating Retailer for details.</p><p>Rewards are valid for a single transaction only. You may combine more than one Reward towards an eligible purchase and, except as otherwise prohibited, Rewards may be used in conjunction with other offers and discounts. If the value of the Reward(s) used is greater than the purchase price of eligible merchandise, before tax, no change will be given and the remaining balance of the Reward(s) will be forfeited. Photocopies, duplicates, and facsimiles of Print Rewards are not valid. Rewards are allocated pro rata across all eligible merchandise and will not be replaced if eligible merchandise is returned. Rewards can be used until their expiration date, unless sooner redeemed.</p><h4>Additional Benefits</h4><p>Ace, in its sole discretion, may offer additional benefits to Program members from time to time. These additional benefits may include:</p><ul><li>Offers and coupons exclusively for members</li><li>Instant savings in-store, on the Site, and/or in the App</li></ul><p>As of 5/21/20 Ace Rewards is suspending its benefit of "Free Delivery with qualifying online orders of $50 or more" due to current circumstances associated with COVID-19.</p><p>Proof of Program membership may be required to take advantage of Program Benefits.</p><h4 id="aceRewardsPremier">Ace Rewards Premier</h4><p>Ace Rewards Premier Eligibility and Expiration: Ace Rewards Premier status is available only to Ace Rewards Program members in good standing. Program members who spend $750 or more in any twelve (12) month period while an Ace Rewards Program member are automatically eligible for Ace Rewards Premier status; provided that corporate/business Program members and Program members with store house accounts are ineligible for Ace Rewards Premier status. Program members for whom we have a valid mailing address will be informed by mail approximately one to two months following the end of the calendar quarter during which they became eligible for Ace Rewards Premier. Information regarding eligibility for Ace Rewards Premier status is available in the App or by contacting <a href="https://www.acehardware.com/customer-service?page=contact-us">Customer Service</a>. Ace Rewards Premier status expires one (1) year from the end of the calendar quarter in which you qualify for Ace Rewards Premier status. Upon expiration of the one-year period, Program members may requalify for Ace Rewards Premier status for subsequent one-year terms if they continue to meet the Ace Rewards Premier eligibility criteria.</p><p>Ace Rewards Premier Benefits: Program members with Ace Rewards Premier status and for whom we have a valid mailing address will be mailed special printed offers and coupons (collectively, "Ace Rewards Premier Coupons"). Ace Rewards Premier Coupons are redeemable at the Participating Retailer identified on the Ace Rewards Premier Coupon and may be accepted by other Participating Retailers, in their sole discretion. Ace, in its sole discretion, determines the nature, amount, and frequency of Ace Rewards Premier Coupons, which Ace may change from time to time with or without notice to you. Not all Ace Rewards Premier Coupons may be made available to all Ace Rewards Premier members. See each Ace Rewards Premier Coupon for any specific terms, limitations, restrictions, and/or exclusions, including expiration dates.</p><h4 id="AceRewardsFrequentBuyerSavings">Ace Rewards Frequent Buyer Savings Pilot Program Official Terms and Conditions</h4><a href="/frequent-buyer-savings" style="display: inline-block;font-weight: bold;text-decoration: none;margin-bottom:30px;margin-top:20px;"><img src="https://cdn-tp3.mozu.com/24645-m1/cms/files/e8b1c034-ca27-45a4-92ad-5b0558ce5be8" width="132" height="130" style="vertical-align: middle;" /><div style="display:inline-block;padding:5px 0 5px 10px;"> View Current Offers</div></a><ol><li>Eligibility: The Ace Rewards Frequent Buyer Savings Pilot Program (the "Ace Rewards Frequent Buyer Savings Pilot Program" or "Pilot Program") is sponsored by Ace Hardware Corporation, 2200 Kensington Court, Oak Brook, Illinois 60523 ("Ace" or "Sponsor") and is open to legal residents of the 50 United States or District of Columbia who are current Ace Rewards members in good standing ("Eligible Customers").

		Purchases made at Ace retail locations that are not Pilot Program Participating Locations or at AceHardware.com do not qualify for the Ace Rewards Frequent Buyer Savings Pilot Program, nor can free items earned in the Frequent Buyer Savings Pilot Program be redeemed at Ace retail locations that are not Pilot Program Participating Locations.
		</li><li>Pilot Program Offers: During the Pilot Program Period, Pilot Program Participating Locations will extend Pilot Program offers (each an "Offer" or collectively the "Offers") that will be posted at acehardware.com/frequent-buyer-savings (the "Frequent Buyer Website"). Each Offer will be for Eligible Customers to purchase certain quantities of specified products at Pilot Program Participating Locations during a stated time period (the "Offer Period") with a designated start date (the "Offer Start Date") and designated end date ("Offer End Date"), which will be set forth in the Offer terms which shall be posted online at the Frequent Buyer Website (the "Offer Terms"). Each individual purchase of a product that makes up the Offer shall be referred to as a "Qualifying Purchase" and completing all of the Qualifying Purchases to fulfill the Offer shall be referred to as meeting the "Purchase Requirements." If the Eligible Customer completes the Purchase Requirements of the Offer during the Offer Period, the Eligible Customer will be entitled to receive the incentive from a Pilot Program Participating Location (while supplies last), which will also be identified within the Offer Terms (the "Incentive"). Many Offers involve multiple purchases of products before the Participating Customer will earn the Incentive. Unless otherwise stated in the Offer Terms, the purchases do not have to be completed in a single transaction, but all required purchases do have to be completed during the Offer Period at a Pilot Program Participating Location. Once the final purchase of the Purchase Requirements of the Offer is completed, the Eligible Customer will have until the Offer End Date to claim the Incentive. Eligible Customers must check out at register with the Incentive item at a Pilot Program Participating Location and may be responsible for payment of applicable tax on the Incentive. If the Incentive is not claimed within that time period, it will be forfeited.<br /><br />

		Pilot Program Offers will be announced at the Frequent Buyer Website and will remain posted throughout the Offer Period.<br /><br />

		No rain checks or substitutions allowed for Qualifying Purchases or Purchase Requirements. Offer can only be fulfilled on current stock at Pilot Program Participating Locations.
		</li><li>Offer Status: During the Offer Period, if an Eligible Customer makes a Qualifying Purchase from an active Offer at a Pilot Program Participating Location, the store-issued receipt will show the Eligible Customer's status for fulfilling the Purchase Requirements for that Offer. During the Offer Period, if an Eligible Customer makes purchases at a Pilot Program Participating Location but those purchases do not include any Qualifying Purchases from an active Offer, there will be no messaging about that Offer on the Eligible Customer's receipt (even if the Eligible Customer has previously made purchases toward that Offer). Eligible Customers should save their receipts when a Qualifying Purchase is made as there is not a method by which Eligible Customers can look up the status of their Qualifying Purchases toward Offers. However, Eligible Customers may find out their status by calling the Care Center at 888-827-4223. Note that there may be a limit on the number of Incentives that a customer may earn in connection with each Offer, as indicated in the Offer Terms.<br /><br /><div style="padding-left:20px;">
				Example:<br /><br />

				Sample Offer: Buy five (5) bags of Scotts&reg; Turf Builder&reg; Weed & Feed (Covers 5000 sq ft 7430952) by August 31, 2021 and get (1) bag of Scotts&reg; Turf Builder&reg; Lawn Food (5000 sq ft., 7314263) for free (the "Sample Scotts Offer").<br /><br />

				On Oct 15th Eligible Customer purchases two (2) bags of Scotts&reg; Turf Builder&reg; Weed & Feed (Covers 5000 sq ft 7430952) at a Pilot Program Participating Location. Eligible Customer's receipt will show the Offer and that Eligible Customer has completed two (2) Qualifying Purchases toward the Purchase Requirements and still needs three (3) more Qualifying Purchases by August 31, 2021 in order to receive the Incentive.<br /><br />

				If on September 20th Eligible Customer visits a Pilot Program Participating Location and purchases items that do not include any Scotts&reg; Turf Builder&reg; Weed & Feed (Covers 5000 sq ft 7430952), there will not be any messaging on said Eligible Customer's receipt about the Sample Scotts Offer.

IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL IMPACT HOW CLAIMS YOU AND ACE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.</p><p>You and Ace agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Ace in connection with the Program shall be resolved exclusively through confidential, final, and binding arbitration. <span class="bold">YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.</span> The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules and a form for initiating arbitration proceedings are available on the AAA's website at: <a href="https://www.adr.org">www.adr.org.</a></p><p>The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, either you or Ace may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on the other party subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.</p><p>The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law.

Unless both you and Ace agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person's or party's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other Program members. <span class="bold">YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO COMMENCE OR PARTICIPATE IN CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS.</span></p><h4>Miscellaneous</h4><p><span class="underline">Applicable Law</span>: The laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern the Program and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Ace.</p><p><span class="underline">Taxes</span>: Program members are solely responsible for any federal, state, or local taxes and/or government fees that may be imposed in connection with the Program.</p><p><span class="underline">Waiver</span>: No delay or failure by Ace to enforce any of these Program Terms shall be a waiver of any of our rights under these Program Terms.</p><p><span class="underline">Severability</span>: The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision(s) of these Program Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any provision of these Program Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, these Program Terms shall be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or unenforceable provision was not contained therein.</p><p><span class="underline">Construction</span>: The headings used in these Program Terms are for convenience only, are not a part of this agreement, and do not affect the interpretation of any of the provisions of these Program Terms.

			The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, either you or we may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on the other party subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.<br /><br />

			The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator's award shall be confidential, final, and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.<br /><br />

			You and we agree that each of us may bring claims against the other (and that you may bring claims against any Ace Incentives Party) only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person's or party's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other purchasers, users or recipients of Cards. <strong>YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO COMMENCE OR PARTICIPATE IN CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS</strong>.

		</li><li><strong>Miscellaneous.</strong><br /><br />

			Applicable Law: The laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern the Card Terms and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Ace Incentives in connection with the Cards.<br /><br />

			Waiver: No delay or failure by Ace Incentives to enforce any of these Card Terms shall be a waiver of any of our rights under these Card Terms.<br /><br />
			
			Severability: The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision(s) of these Card Terms shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision. In the event that any provision of these Card Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, these Card Terms shall be construed in accordance with their terms as if the invalid or unenforceable provision was not contained therein.<br /><br />
			
			Construction: The headings used in these Card Terms are for convenience only, are not a part of this agreement, and do not affect the interpretation of any of the provisions of these Card Terms. Any reference to the term "including" means "including, without limitation." <br /><br />
			
			Survival: The provisions regarding disclaimer of warranties, limitation of liability, arbitration agreement, prohibition of class and representative actions and non-individualized relief, and these miscellaneous provisions shall survive termination of the Card Terms.
