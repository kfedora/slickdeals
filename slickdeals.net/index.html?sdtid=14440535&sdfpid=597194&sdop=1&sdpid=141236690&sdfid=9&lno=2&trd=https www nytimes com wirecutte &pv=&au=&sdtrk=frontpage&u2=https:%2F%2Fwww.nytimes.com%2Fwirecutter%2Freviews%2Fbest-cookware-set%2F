The pros we talked to said that All-Clad tri-ply cookware is the best for both professional and home use because it’s so durable. In our tests, the All-Clad pans heated evenly, were comfortable to hold, and tackled every cooking job without any hiccups. Though the largest skillet measures only 10 inches instead of 12, this set will outfit your kitchen with all the other pots and pans you’re ever likely to need. And if you’re partial to keeping your cookware bright and shiny, note that in our tests this set was one of the few that looked like new after cleaning.</p></section><div class="_17850657"

Cookware sets also make great gifts for weddings and graduations, or for anyone setting up their kitchen for the first time.</p><p>Perhaps you already own stainless steel cookware but it’s dented, warped, or inclined to cook unevenly—if that’s the case, you’re probably due for an upgrade. Or maybe you have a set of nonstick cookware. In that case, we think upgrading to a stainless steel set is worth doing because you’ll gain greater durability and longevity from your pots and pans—in some cases, they will last a lifetime. Nonstick cookware, on the other hand, needs to be replaced every few years once the coating deteriorates. (We make a thorough case for switching from nonstick to stainless steel cookware in our blog post “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/food-sticking-pan/">How to Keep Food From Sticking to a (Not-Nonstick) Pan</a>.”)</p><aside class="a869c42a"><p data-scp="pullquote">Buying a set of cookware is a convenient and affordable alternative to tracking down pots and pans one piece at a time.</p></aside><p>Stainless steel is more versatile than nonstick cookware because you can cook over higher heat without damaging the pan, which is critical for getting a good sear on meats. Stainless steel pans will give your food a rich color and develop better fond (the caramelized bits that form on the bottom of a pan), resulting in more flavorful food. Stainless steel is also great for high-heat tasks like stir-frying and pan-frying. Many cooks love that it can go directly from the stovetop to the broiler. Also, stainless steel pans can go into the dishwasher; nonstick pieces can’t (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-nonstick-pan/#care-and-maintenance">heat and harsh detergents break down the nonstick coating</a>).</p><figure id="attachment_11281" class="wp-caption alignnone"><figure class="_92ef929f global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="a stainless steel pan we tested as part of our cookware set testing process" width="630" height="420" src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-4977-120x80.jpg" class="df5db67b _45d01177 size-full wp-image-11281" data-sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" data-srcset="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-4977.jpg 630w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-4977-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-4977-570x380.jpg 570w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-4977-330x220.jpg 330w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-4977-200x134.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-4977-120x80.jpg 120w"/></figure><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"> Stainless steel allows you to cook over higher heat without damaging the pan, which is critical for getting a good sear on meats.<!-- --> <span class="wp-caption-text wp-caption-credit">Photo: Michael Hession</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing this guide doesn’t include is a cheap, basic cookware set that you might use to outfit a rental or vacation home, or to send with kids to college.

Hugh Rushing, former executive vice president of CMA, told us, “You get about what you pay for when it comes to cookware. And there is a relationship between the price of the product and the quality of the materials and the manufacturing expertise that goes into it.” In most cases, it’s worth paying more for better quality. If you want to spend less or don’t intend to cook often, we’d recommend getting only the essential pieces of cookware for your kitchen: a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-skillet/">skillet</a>, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-small-saucepan/">saucepan</a>, and a stockpot.</p><p>Most cookware sets include smaller pot and pan sizes, so they aren’t the best option for the experienced home cook who wants to prepare large meals. Though cookware costs more when sold separately, purchasing it this way allows you to acquire specific pieces that suit your exact cooking needs (see our guides to the best <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-skillet/">skillet</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-cast-iron-skillet/">cast iron skillet</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-nonstick-pan/">nonstick pan</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-small-saucepan/">saucepan</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-roasting-pan/">roasting pan</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-dutch-oven/">Dutch oven</a>).</p></div></section><section class="e1e9ed3a" id="how-we-picked"><h2 class="_60d21928" aria-controls="how-we-picked-panel" aria-selected="true" role="tab" tabindex="0" data-gtm-element="chapter_heading">How we picked<button class="_26f76ff6" aria-expanded="true" aria-pressed="false" aria-haspopup="false" data-scp="chapter_toggle"></button></h2><div id="how-we-picked-panel" class="_621a71d4" aria-labelledby="how-we-picked" aria-hidden="false" role="tabpanel"><figure id="attachment_11282" class="wp-caption alignnone"><figure class="_92ef929f global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="several cookware sets we tested" width="630" height="420" src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-5189-120x80.jpg" class="df5db67b _45d01177 size-full wp-image-11282" data-sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" data-srcset="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-5189.jpg 630w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-5189-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-5189-570x380.jpg 570w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-5189-330x220.jpg 330w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-5189-200x134.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-5189-120x80.jpg 120w"/></figure><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"> We&#x27;ve tested 17 cookware sets for this guide.<!-- --> <span class="wp-caption-text wp-caption-credit">Photo: Michael Hession</span></figcaption></figure><p>Because cookware is the cornerstone of any kitchen, we wanted to find sets that included the most useful pot and pan sizes. We also looked for sets that could retain and distribute heat well to allow you to cook without fear of hot spots. Additionally, we searched for cookware that was durable, yet still lightweight enough that it’s comfortable to hold. Here’s a list of the most important qualities we looked for (and avoided) when choosing cookware sets to test:</p><h3>Optimal pot and pan sizes</h3><p>Though most people are inclined to buy sets because doing so is cheaper than buying pieces individually, sets involve a compromise. Most manufacturers cut corners by including smaller pot and pan sizes in a set to reduce the overall price. Rushing told us that “shrinking the pot and pan sizes might only be a 5 or 6 percent difference in cost [for the manufacturer], but it drops the bottom line.” Smaller pan sizes require you to cook in batches and can slow you down in the kitchen. Candy Argondizza, then vice president of culinary and pastry arts at International Culinary Center, told us, “Sets often sell you pieces that you don’t need. I like to pick and choose what I want. It might be a little more expensive this way, but space is a commodity in my tiny kitchen, so I choose what I need wisely.” Janet Crandall, a Los Angeles private chef and cooking instructor, agreed, saying, “I prefer to buy individual pans. Sometimes sets don’t always have the exact size I want.”</p><p>Both Argondizza and Crandall gave suggestions for the best pot and pan sizes to look for. Note that the number of pieces advertised in a set includes lids, so you’re generally getting half the listed number of pots and pans. A good set should include the following 10 pieces:</p><ul><li><strong>1.5- to 2-quart saucepan with a lid:</strong> For reheating a small amount of soup or melting butter</li><li><strong>3- to 4-quart saucepan with a lid:</strong> For making sauces or reheating stocks and soups</li><li><strong>8- and 10-inch or 10- and 12-inch skillets:</strong> For searing meats and sautéing vegetables</li><li><strong>3- to 4-quart skillet with a lid:</strong> For quickly reducing sauces, making roux, and preparing shallow braises</li><li><strong>8-quart (or larger) stockpot with a lid:</strong> For boiling water for pasta, handling large-batch sauces, or making stocks, soups, and stews</li></ul><p>We found that most skillets in sets are only 8 to 10 inches, but we prefer 10- and 12-inch versions because they offer a larger surface area for cooking more at once. This was one of the factors that set our previous pick from Tramontina (which has now been discontinued) apart from the competition. Our new pick is a very similar set from Tramontina, but it includes 8- and 10-inch skillets. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to find any other sets that included 10- and 12-inch skillets and also met our other requirements. Many sets also have stockpots that are only 6 quarts, which is too small for making large batches of stock (8-quart or larger stockpots are best for preparing stocks and provide ample room for boiling pasta). The smaller pan sizes offered in most sets are the main incentive for buying what you need piece by piece.</p><aside class="a869c42a"><p data-scp="pullquote">After years of long-term testing, we don’t think you can get a quality set for under $250.</p></aside><p>You can always purchase other essential pieces, such as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-dutch-oven/">Dutch oven</a>, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-cast-iron-skillet/">cast iron skillet</a>, and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-nonstick-pan/">nonstick pan</a>, in addition to your main set. Don’t be tempted to buy huge sets with lots of pieces. Most of the pots and pans in those larger sets are just filler. Ultimately, those pieces won’t see much use and will only clutter up your kitchen. Our experts agreed that you’re better off getting a set with fewer but better-quality pieces you’ll reach for again and again.</p><h3>Comfortable weight</h3><p>The ideal weight and balance of cookware will be different for everyone. However, most of our testers preferred skillets that weighed between 2 and 3½ pounds, which were still light enough for tossing ingredients in a pan without placing too much torque on their wrists. We took the advice of our pros and looked at many cookware sets in person before testing, to get a feel for the weight and the actual size of the pots and pans. Getting a sense of each set just by looking at pictures online is difficult.</p><p>Additionally, we limited our search to cookware with sloped sides. Some skillets, such as this <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/14014/40138/4/59242/?merchant=Wayfair" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Wayfair" data-vars-store="Wayfair" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/14014/40138/4/59242/?merchant=Wayfair">Viking Contemporary Frying Pan</a>, have sharply angled sides that make tossing vegetables while sautéing difficult.</p><h3>Durability and even heat distribution</h3><p>Ideally, we wanted sets of fully clad tri-ply stainless steel, which has an aluminum core sandwiched between layers of stainless steel extending up the sides of the pan. Fully clad tri-ply stainless steel is the best option for both pros and home cooks because of its even heat distribution (aluminum heats up quickly and distributes heat well; steel is very durable and holds heat nicely). It’s also very durable and dishwasher safe. Unlike aluminum, stainless steel is nonreactive to acidic ingredients like tomatoes or vinegar, so it won’t leave behind a metallic taste. And unlike nonstick cookware, you can use stainless steel pans over high heat and move them directly from the stovetop to the oven. Bottom line: Good-quality stainless steel pans are buy-it-for-life items.</p><p>In addition to making tri-ply cookware, most high-end manufacturers produce sets that are made from five or more layers of stainless steel, aluminum, and sometimes copper. With each additional layer, the pans become more expensive. In most of our tests, five-ply cookware didn’t heat as uniformly as regular tri-ply cookware, or the differences were negligible. One exception was the <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/17441/165614/4/74843/?merchant=Amazon" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Amazon" data-vars-store="Amazon" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/17441/165614/4/74843/?merchant=Amazon">Demeyere 5-Plus 10-Piece Cookware Set</a>, which heated impressively evenly. That said, the pans in this set took longer to heat up than those in the All-Clad set. Five-ply cookware also holds onto more heat, so it’s slower to react when you lower the heat on your stove. Ultimately, we don’t think the extra cost of five-ply cookware is worth it.</p><aside class="a869c42a"><p data-scp="pullquote">Fully clad tri-ply stainless steel is the best option for both pros and home cooks because of its even heat distribution.</p></aside><p>We did our best to avoid sets that aren’t fully clad, meaning the aluminum core doesn’t extend up the sides of the cookware, because they’re prone to scorching. However, if you’re looking for a cheap set, cookware with tri-ply disks welded to the bottom of the pan (also called encapsulated bottoms) will distribute heat more evenly than pans made from a single piece of stainless steel. In our experience, sets with encapsulated bottoms performed better than those that had just a single layer of stainless steel, but we still wouldn’t recommend them. Fully clad tri-ply cookware is the way to go.</p><figure id="attachment_11286" class="wp-caption alignnone"><figure class="_92ef929f global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="a comparison of two pots as part of our cookware sets testing process" width="630" height="420" src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-5272-120x80.jpg" class="df5db67b _45d01177 size-full wp-image-11286" data-sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" data-srcset="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-5272.jpg 630w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-5272-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-5272-570x380.jpg 570w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-5272-330x220.jpg 330w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-5272-200x134.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-5272-120x80.jpg 120w"/></figure><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"> Our testers preferred cookware that’s fully clad, such as the Tramontina saucepan (right), as opposed to pans with encapsulated bottoms, like the Cuisinart Chef’s Classic saucepan (left), which are prone to scorching on the sides.<!-- --> <span class="wp-caption-text wp-caption-credit">Photo: Michael Hession</span></figcaption></figure><h3>Materials to avoid</h3><ul><li><strong>Aluminum</strong> is reactive to acidic foods and can give them a metallic taste. It’s also not induction cooktop compatible. (Because induction burners transfer heat through a magnetic field, cookware must contain sufficient amounts of iron, such as cast iron or magnetic stainless steel, in order to be compatible.)</li><li><strong>Anodized aluminum</strong> has a dark color that can make it hard to see if foods are browning properly, which is especially important for challenging tasks like making caramel. It can also be more difficult to clean than stainless steel because it’s harder to see if you’ve scrubbed off every bit of burned-on oil.</li><li><strong>Nonstick sets</strong> aren’t ideal for high-heat cooking such as searing and have a shorter life span than regular stainless steel, because their coating wears off within a few years. (Having one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-nonstick-pan/">nonstick pan</a> in your batterie de cuisine is all you need for preparing eggs.)</li><li><strong>Carbon steel</strong>, like cast iron, requires more upkeep to maintain the cooking surface and can rust if not properly seasoned.</li><li><strong>Cast iron</strong> is heavy, reactive to acidic food, and more difficult to maintain. However, we recommend that you have at least one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-cast-iron-skillet/">cast iron skillet</a> in your kitchen because it’s such a versatile pan. You can use it for everything from roasting a whole chicken to baking cornbread.</li><li><strong>Copper</strong> is an excellent conductor of heat, but it’s very expensive and difficult to maintain. However, we did test the <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24521/130679/4/74844/?merchant=Williams-Sonoma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Williams-Sonoma" data-vars-store="Williams-Sonoma" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/24521/130679/4/74844/?merchant=Williams-Sonoma">All-Clad Copper Core 10-Piece Cookware Set</a> because it has a stainless steel exterior.</li></ul><h3>Features and accessories to avoid</h3><p>We excluded sets with glass lids because they can break or crack easily if dropped. They also offer little advantage over stainless steel lids because you can’t see through them when they’re covered with condensation. Pot and pan lids should fit well but somewhat loosely, with just enough wiggle room to allow steam to escape.</p><p>We dismissed sets with plastic handles, because even those made to withstand high temperatures can deteriorate over time. Ideally, we wanted cookware that could safely withstand oven temperatures of at least 500 degrees Fahrenheit, which ruled out most plastic components. Several members of our staff have also seen plastic handles crack after spending time in the dishwasher.</p><figure id="attachment_11287" class="wp-caption alignnone"><figure class="_92ef929f global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="a comparison of two saucepans as part of our cookware set testing process" width="630" height="420" src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-6376-120x80.jpg" class="df5db67b _45d01177 size-full wp-image-11287" data-sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" data-srcset="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-6376.jpg 630w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-6376-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-6376-570x380.jpg 570w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-6376-330x220.jpg 330w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-6376-200x134.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cookwear-lowres-6376-120x80.jpg 120w"/></figure><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"> We looked for saucepans with stick handles, such as the Tramontina (left), and avoided saucepans that have two side handles, like the one included in the All-Clad set from Williams Sonoma (right).<!-- --> <span class="wp-caption-text wp-caption-credit">Photo: Michael Hession</span></figcaption></figure><p>Stick handles that provide an easy grip and a comfortable angle allow you to quickly move saucepans around the stovetop one-handed, so we dismissed sets with small or medium saucepans that have two side handles. We also looked for sets that included a hole for hanging on each handle. Side handles are best for larger saucepans (those over 4 quarts) and stockpots, which have a bigger volume and require two hands to lift.</p><p>Many sets include a pasta insert or steamer basket for stockpots, but these pieces are superfluous. In our experience, they take up too much space or have a shallow design that doesn’t allow enough circulation for pasta when boiling.</p><h3>A note on how cookware sets are sold</h3><p>Cookware manufacturers often sell variations of the same cookware set to different retailers. They do this primarily to avoid competition among big-box stores, such as Target and Walmart, that sell similar items. Rushing said, “No retailer wants to have a directly comparable product to another retailer that’s their competitor.” For instance, one store may sell a set of cookware with a saucepan that has a stick handle, and another store might sell the same set with a saucepan that has two side handles. If you want to avoid the hassle of searching multiple retailers for these variations in an attempt to find the most useful set, take heart: We’ve already done that for you. We tested the best version of each cookware set we could find across multiple retailers.</p></div></section><section class="e1e9ed3a" id="how-we-tested"><h2 class="_60d21928" aria-controls="how-we-tested-panel" aria-selected="true" role="tab" tabindex="0" data-gtm-element="chapter_heading">How we tested<button class="_26f76ff6" aria-expanded="true" aria-pressed="false" aria-haspopup="false" data-scp="chapter_toggle"></button></h2><div id="how-we-tested-panel" class="_621a71d4" aria-labelledby="how-we-tested" aria-hidden="false" role="tabpanel"><p>For each set, we started by testing how well the large skillets retained heat by making a heat map of their cooking surface using an infrared thermometer.

Set</a> for its even heat distribution, durable construction, and affordable price. The Tramontina skillets produced perfectly brown chicken pieces with nice fond development, and the saucepans and stockpot simmered liquids without scorching. We found the wide handles on both the cookware and the lids comfortable to hold. Though this cookware discolored over high heat, the effect was common among all of the sets we tested in this price range. All of the cookware in this collection is dishwasher-safe, induction-compatible, and oven-safe up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>Included in this Tramontina set are 12 pieces: 8- and 10-inch skillets, a 6-quart deep sauté pan with a lid, 1½-, 2-, and 3-quart saucepans with lids, and an 8-quart stockpot with a lid. Though we wish this set included a larger 12-inch skillet instead of an 8-inch skillet, the 6-quart deep sauté pan is 11¾ inches in diameter (and about 3¼ inches deep), so it comfortably fits a whole chicken cut up. If you want to grow your set, the Tramontina 12-inch skillet can be purchased separately—we recommend it as our runner-up pick in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-skillet/">our guide to the best skillet</a>. Alternatively, all of these pieces are sold open stock, so you can piece together your own version of this set with just the pieces that you want (If we were to do that, we&#x27;d skip the 8-inch skillet, and get a 10-inch and a 12-inch skillet instead).</p><figure id="attachment_141013" class="wp-caption alignnone"><figure class="_92ef929f global_chapter__arp_image"><img alt="The Tramontina 12-piece set including an 8-quart stockpot with a lid, 3-, 2-, and 1½-quart saucepans with lids, 8- and 10-inch skillets, and a 6-quart deep sauté pan with a lid." width="636" height="424" src="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cookware-lowres-5288-120x80.jpg" class="df5db67b _45d01177 wp-image-141013 size-full" data-sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" data-srcset="https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cookware-lowres-5288.jpg 636w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cookware-lowres-5288-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cookware-lowres-5288-630x420.jpg 630w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cookware-lowres-5288-570x380.jpg 570w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cookware-lowres-5288-330x220.jpg 330w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cookware-lowres-5288-200x134.jpg 200w, https://cdn.thewirecutter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cookware-lowres-5288-120x80.jpg 120w"/></figure><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"> The Tramontina 12-piece set includes (clockwise from top left): an 8-quart stockpot with a lid, 3-, 2-, and 1½-quart saucepans with lids, 8- and 10-inch skillets, and a 6-quart deep sauté pan with a lid.<!-- --> <span class="wp-caption-text wp-caption-credit">Photo: Sarah Kobos</span></figcaption></figure><p>In our tests, the Tramontina 3-quart saucepan made perfect caramel without burning, though some of our testers found they had to swirl the pan more to distribute the heat evenly.

The pots and pans have the perfect weight, and they cooked food more evenly than our top-pick set due to their superior heat conduction.

However, this set is prone to hot spots because it’s not fully clad. The single layer of stainless steel around the perimeter of the pan is too thin to evenly distribute heat and causes food to burn. We think that if you’re on a budget, you’re better off getting fewer, higher quality pieces of cookware that will give you better results and last longer.

However, most of our testers found the stick handles on the skillets to be uncomfortably low, preferring the higher angle of the handles on our picks. At the time of our testing, the Made In cookware had cooking instructions etched on the bottom of the pans, which we felt was a bit cheesy, especially if you plan to hang them on a wall (and not particularly helpful while you’re using the pans).

Also, the nonstick pan is only 8.5 inches, so it’s not as versatile as the 10-inch pans we recommend in our guide to nonstick skillets, and it has a ceramic coating, which we’ve found quickly loses its nonstick properties. The set’s only other skillet, a 10.25-inch skillet/sauté pan hybrid, is also on the small side.</p><h3>Priced between $600 to $800</h3><p>The <a class="product-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/17430/53930/4/59247/?merchant=Williams-Sonoma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-gtm-trigger="product_link" data-store="Williams-Sonoma" data-vars-store="Williams-Sonoma" data-vars-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/out/link/17430/53930/4/59247/?merchant=Williams-Sonoma">All-Clad d5 Brushed Stainless 10-Piece Set</a> held onto heat more, so it took longer for us to make caramel and achieve nicely golden-brown chicken.
