  I wanted to post that in <a href="http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/nights/nights.htm" rel="external nofollow">their article for the NiGHTS series</a>,
  hardcoregaming101.net recommended checking out this album. FWIW,
  I don't recall that many fan arrangement recommendations in their
  articles! The article was posted this June.

  I finally got ahold of that picture of Yuji Naka and Takashi
  Iizuka holding Lucid Dreaming. Just look at Iizuka's face. LOOK
  AT THAT JAW ALMOST HITTING THE FLOOR. That was the instant he was
  told that this was an unofficial fan-made project. <img src="/community/uploads/emoticons/default_icon_glee.gif" alt=":)!!">

  Video games seem to have it all. Even from their early arcade
  days, when the game had a singular, simplistic objective, video
  games had the populace enamoured. As time progressed, they
  expanded, evolving into interactive complex stories with surprise
  twists, with a variety of increasingly spectacular gameplay, not
  to mention the inevitable increase in graphic quality. One of the
  things that has always been at the core of great gaming, however,
  has been the soundtracks. To keep the sound of a game fresh and
  interesting when you have hours upon hours of playing ahead of
  you is a feat in and of itself, but audio directors always find
  new ways to go above and beyond when it comes to catchy game
  music. But for some of the older video games, from the 64-bit era
  and beyond, their soundtracks find themselves being lost to the
  ravages of time despite their superior quality because the sound
  has become outdated in these High Definition times. Thankfully, a
  website called OverClocked Remix has made it their mission to
  remix popular video game soundtracks, bringing a whole new
  dimension to the catchy tunes that filled our childhood. One of
  their most recent collaborations is entitled “NiGHTS: Lucid
  Dreaming,” an album comprised entirely of remixes from the Sega
  Dreamcast game “NiGHTS into Dreams.”

  And now for the 2nd Dream. I’ll be honest, this is the only song
  on the album I’ve listened to before reviewing it. But hey, it’s
  a good track. To quote Stevo in the Director’s Comments file,
  “Sixto must be Joe Satriani in disguise, because if I didn’t know
  any better, I’d say this was the Satch himself covering NiGHTS.”
  I agree with this. Clearer guitar for a bit of a solo at 2:16 or
  so. Also, this is Sixto’s longest track to date, which is a very
  good thing. He’s in top form, shredding riffs in a very ethereal
  manner, giving the entire song a very mystical, fantastical
  quality. Compared to most of Juan’s work, this is much calmer,
  and he pulls it off quite well. 4:47 brings in what quite
  possibly could be some of Sixto’s most beautiful work. He shreds
  and shreds and shreds until 5:30, when it slowly comes to an end.
  Far too soon!
</p>
<p>
  2. AkumajoBelmont – I’ll Fly You (nel cielo notturno) [Paternal
  Horn] 3:14
</p>
<p>
  More of Akuma’s work. Now while I’m not sure what nel cielo
  notturno means, or even what language it is, I’m sure this song
  will be high quality. And sure enough, the infectious rhythm
  common to most of his songs takes control nearly immediately. As
  usual, great lyrics and great singing. Does that even have to be
  said anymore? A slight breakdown at the two minute mark. Chorus
  returns at 2:36. Great song.
</p>
<p>
  3. Geshen of Balamb – Urban Museum (Suburban Museum) 2:22
</p>
<p>
  How very classical. At least until the rhythm comes into the
  background of this soundscape. This song’s style seems to be in
  opposition to the rest of the album at first glance, but upon
  further listening it fits right into place like the final piece
  of a jigsaw puzzle that you had lost for years. The end is near
  at 2:06.
</p>
<p>
  4. Benjamin Briggs – She Had Angry Pixels (She Had Long Ears)
  3:24
</p>
<p>
  And another chth track! And it’s a remix this time!! Classic chth
  chippiness here; which is very good. Just like Fishy’s take on
  the track, this is pretty crazy. Also very chippy, which I love.
  Instrument change at 1:04 or so. 1:28 brings in an effect right
  off the NES sound card. Ominous buildup at 1:54 or so which
  explodes at 2:18 ever so slightly. It keeps building and
  building, even through 2:44 when another phase kicks in. This is
  the longest buildup I’ve listened to. It finally explodes at
  3:10, right before the end of the track.
</p>
<p>
  5. Sundog – Trans-Siberian Tuning Fork (Take The Snow Train) 6:17
</p>
<p>
  Another long track, a mere eleven seconds shorter than Rozo’s
  epic. It kicks off ambiently, until 0:36 when some chimes kick
  in. The motifs that stream throughout the album like
  commonalities in the subconscious world of sleep are just as
  present in this song. Sax at 2:14. Nice bass at 3:02. Some cool
  acoustic guitar at 3:14. This whole song’s atmosphere just
  changed! This is quite a beautiful track, I must say. More motif
  usage at 4:50 or so. I really like how pervasive the bass is; it
  really adds to the soundscape. At 5:49 or so, it starts to build
  to the finale. At 5:59, the soundscape clears out for the end.
</p>
<p>
  6. Cyril the Wolf, Level 99, Brandon Snell – Clawz Jam (E-LE-KI
  Sparkle) 3:42
</p>
<p>
  Guitar right off the bat!! It’s quite epic, I must say. Sounds
  like a jam I’d hear on a classic rock station. Solo at 1:24.
  Actually, I take that back since this whole song is an EPIC
  TRIPLE GUITAR SOLO!!! Never thought that joke would become a
  reality. But hey, I’m extremely happy it has. I’d have posted
  more timestamps, but this song is just too awesome to pay
  attention to something as small as timestamps. Just know that the
  entirety of the song is quite possibly one of the most awesome
  things I’ve ever listened to. I hope you agree. The end begins at
  3:31.
</p>
<p>
  7. José the Bronx Rican – Overnight Cloverleaf (Gloom of The
  N.H.C.) 4:44
</p>
<p>
  And now for OCR’s resident media man, José the Bronx Rican.
  Starts out smooth and calm. Another very ethereal track, and
  everything in it sounds like there was a meticulous amount of
  attention paid to it. Main melody at 1:18 or so. A nice solo at
  2:38. It just keeps going and going, like the Energizer bunny.
  Back to the main track at 3:54. The end begins at 4:37.
</p>
<p>
  8. Avaris, Level 99 – Restless Depths (Deep It Lies) 3:06
</p>
<p>
  Choir singing to begin the track. It ends quickly at 0:18, as the
  base of the song is slowly built up one piece at a time. The
  vocal clips are interspersed at certain parts of the track.
  Electric guitar at 1:14. This song sounds like it’s setting up
  the grand finale of the album as a whole, an aural tour of the
  game world much like these, my aural tours of these albums. Great
  guitar work at 2:29. The soundscape gets fuller and fuller with
  each passing second.
</p>
<p>
  9. Level 99 – Twin Seeds Flyby (Growing Wings) 3:45
</p>
<p>
  Ooh, happy sounding. I’m enjoying this track already. Some synth
  at 0:39 or so, but it quickly gives way to guitar. The two keep
  switching roles and mixing with each other throughout, giving a
  very nice cooperative feel to the track. Solo at 1:49 or so.
  Synth solo at 2:30. The two keep switching places. 2:54 gives of
  a victorious vibe. It calms down to acoustic guitar at 3:03 in
  preparation for the end of the track. Vocal clips are present
  here, of WHOO-HOAAA!!!!
</p>
<p>
  10. Josh Whelchel feat. Danielle Messina, Ryan C. Connelly –
  Dies, Nox et Omnia (D’Force Master) 6:22
</p>
<p>
  This starts out scratchy, with clear chimes. This will be another
  intense track like The Nemesis Schema, I can already tell. More
  chimes at 1:02 or so. The soundscape suddenly fills at 1:20, with
  ominous bass. Ominous strings join at 1:30, with synth shortly
  after. The scratchiness falls away, bringing in some horns to
  really give the track an ominous feel. 2:04 has some drums that
  really fill it. Some opera singing at 2:22 or so, no doubt
  courtesy of Danielle Messina; I doubt Josh or Ryan has those
  pipes. Speaking of Ryan, I’m pretty sure he comes in at 2:50 or
  so with his own singing. In Latin, too! And they say it’s a dead
  language! Ominous keys at 3:33 or so. The two sing over each
  other at 3:54, for a truly epic feel; the instrumentation helps
  immensely as well. It drops suddenly at 4:31. At 4:42, it starts
  to build back up with Ryan’s singing; instrumentation returns at
  5:02 with Danielle rejoining at 5:04. At 5:35 or so, the song
  takes on a feel of finality, which makes sense. The end is not
  too far off at this point. At 5:54, everything slows down, and
  the piano takes center stage to end it all.
</p>
<p>
  11. Level 99 and The Dreamers – The World Is Dreaming (Dreams
  Dreams) 5:24
</p>
<p>
  Starts off slow, with source usage right away. Guitar and
  clapping at 0:22. I can’t help but join it. Singing at 0:44!
  Multiple vocalists! I’m liking The Dreamers; I want to hear more
  from them. Lyrics are well-written; wait… is this another version
  of Dreams Dreams (Disco NiGHTS Mix)? I think it is! What a way to
  fuse the album into an even more cohesive listening experience!
  Everyone sings extremely well in this; I’m really enjoying this.
  A flute solo kicks off at the four minute mark. Pure vocals and
  clapping at 4:24! Who needs backing music? This group does fine
  without it; the music returns at 4:44 though. Pure singing at
  5:08 brings about the end of the track, as they fade away.
</p>
<p>
  12. Emunator – Sleepless Nights (Gate of Your Dream) 4:30
</p>
<p>
  And now for Emunator’s turn for a beautiful take on this track.
  It’s slow, but beautiful. The soundscape slowly builds and builds
  with the resonance of the piano keys. It’s really well done; Wes
  really, and literally, hit all the right notes on this one. I’d
  say more, but it’s just a piano remix, which is quite awesome.
  That also means no real need for timestamps, since there’s only
  one instrument. So just listen and enjoy the song as I am right
  now. It starts to end at 3:38 or so, as everything calms down and
  the soundscape empties out.
</p>
<p>
  13. Skrypnyk – A Dream… (Beautiful) [Gate of Your Dream] 4:20
</p>
<p>
  Just as we entered the Gate of Your Dream to begin the disc, we
  exit it for the end with Wes’s take and this one. Starts off…
  interesting. But I wouldn’t expect anything less from Skrypnyk.
  It builds and builds until 0:55 when the main meat kicks in. It
  really begins at 1:10. Quite ethereal in its presentation, I must
  say; a fitting finale for the album. Source usage at 1:58 or so.
  It’s a beautiful track, which honestly took me by surprise based
  on the beginning. It just builds and builds, like the final leg
  of a journey. You know the end is close, and there’s not much
  that can stop you, so you take your time and truly experience the
  beauty of your surroundings. The end begins at about 3:28 or so.
  A vocal clip ends the track. And with that, we awaken from the
  dream. The album ends in grand fashion.
</p>
<p>
  CONCLUSION
</p>
<p>
  I’ll start this conclusion off with a revelation. I have never
  played the original NiGHTS; growing up, I had never really even
  heard about the Sega Saturn, and it was a system I had completely
  skipped. To this day, I have still never even seen a Sega Saturn
  in person with my own two eyes. I know there are many great games
  on the system, and among them all, NiGHTS is the one I’ve heard
  the most praise for. The gameplay, the world, the story; all are
  up there with the greats. And the music… well, if it weren’t for
  the music, I wouldn’t really be here writing this review, now
  would I? With this fact comes the realization that unlike the
  remix albums I’ve reviewed before, this one is of a soundtrack I
  am completely unfamiliar with. I’m more familiar with the stars
  in the far reaches of our universe than I am with this game, but
  as a journalist I trudged on with this review. And you know what?
  I’m glad I did.
</p>
<p>
  Despite the unfamiliarity I hold with the source tunes, I can
  easily tell that this album was most definitely a labor of love.
  As I listened, I began to get sucked into the music and began to
  recognize the tracks due to the flowing motifs of Dreams Dreams
  and other tracks. And now, once I am able to, I plan on somehow
  managing to experience the game for myself. This album… well, I
  can’t really summarize this album in a brief manner. Everything I
  can say about it is contained in the track-by-track reviews
  above. Nothing else can really be said without being redundant,
  and honestly, not much more needs to be said. I highly recommend
  this album, even if you’ve never even heard the original music as
  in my case. All these songs are phenomenal, and all of them are
  highly HIGHLY recommended. So go ahead, download this album if
  you haven’t already. I guarantee you won’t regret it at all.
  Until next time, game on!!

<div style="overflow:hidden;padding-bottom:20px;">
<p>
  I promised Stevo I'd post this here, so here it is. My review,
  entitled "Dream a Dream of Remixes."
</p>
<p>
  ------------------------------------------
</p>
<p>
  And now for a project that I’m sure was among the biggest labors
  of love for the director. Having interviewed Level 99 in early
  2010, I know there’s at least one track here he’s quite proud of.
  But as a whole, I’m sure everyone involved is happy with what
  they’ve contributed on some level. Released on the 15th
  anniversary of the original game’s release, this commemorative
  album has gotten lots of positive reviews. Will this be another
  such review? Probably; I never really hate anything I listen to.
  And now, to the meat of the article! Let the music begin!!
</p>
<p>
  DISC 1
</p>
<p>
  1. MattInc – Panzer Nightopia (Message From Nightopia) 2:38
</p>
<p>
  Starts out ambient, and this is a great way to introduce the
  album. 0:25 brings in some beat. 0:52 brings in some violin or
  something. And just past the one minute mark brings in more
  ambience. More of the violin at 1:29. Breakdown and switch-up at
  1:58. This really sets the tone for the album as a whole. It
  starts to fade out slowly, preparing the ears for the next track.
</p>
<p>
  2. AkumajoBelmont, Level 99 – Dreams Dreams (Disco NiGHTS Mix)
  [Dreams Dreams] 3:20
</p>
<p>
  I love Robbie’s stuff, and with Stevo on board this can be
  nothing but epic. And 0:19 sets my ears up for a hell of a
  discotacular experience. Lyrics are great as always. I can
  imagine Disco Stu from The Simpsons grooving to this. Akuma’s
  rapid singing in this at parts is really well-done; rapid but
  coherent. 2:00 brings in a GUITAR SOLO no doubt courtesy of Level
  99. Lyrics back at 2:30. 3:00 brings the impending ending with
  more guitar.
</p>
<p>
  3. pu_freak – From Dusk til Dawn (Fragmented Nights) 4:40
</p>
<p>
  And now, the maestro pu_freak shall play From Dusk til Dawn in A
  minor. Or something. Regardless, it’s a mellow piano piece, which
  I’ve come to expect from pu_freak. It slowly starts to build,
  until 1:02 when it slows down for a purely piano part. Chimes are
  interspersed throughout. 2:30 brings about another building
  segment of the song. 3:10 builds even more with a very driving
  rhythm coming in. What we need is a Rexy/pu_freak epic piano
  collaboration. It slowly dies down starting at about 4:02.
</p>
<p>
  4. LuIzA – Lies Within Dreams (Deep It Lies) 3:06
</p>
<p>
  And now for LuIzA; this track kicks in right away, with her
  signature guitar at 0:09! More keys at 0:28. Guitar mixes with
  the keys for a truly awesome soundscape. Slight breakdown at 1:27
  or so with organ-like keys. A major switch-up at 2:04 or so.
  Sorry, I just got so absorbed into the song I completely forgot
  to pay attention to timestamps. And now it’s over. Too soon, too
  soon!
</p>
<p>
  5. Rozovian – Reverse Rain (The Amazing Water) 6:28
</p>
<p>
  Nice and calm to begin with. It slowly builds. I’m expecting a
  lot of this since the track is so long. As Rozo has said before,
  length happens. The main melody keeps playing, and the soundscape
  keeps getting fuller and fuller. I feel like I’m on a journey
  myself, getting closer to the destination, just by listening to
  this. And it’s only halfway over. Nice chimes at 3:28 or so.
  Finally, a timestamp! This is quite an enchanting little track.
  Okay, maybe little is the wrong word. 4:44 has some nice little
  instrumentation that just adds to the enchanting effect. I can
  already tell this track will stay with me long after I finish
  writing this review. Nice wind instrument at 5:29 or so. This
  also marks the slow reduction in instruments to bring about the
  inevitable end of the track. I have to say, this track did have a
  very aqueous quality to it. Fantastic work, Rozo!!
</p>
<p>
  6. Fishy – She Can Has Long Ears (She Had Long Ears) 3:52
</p>
<p>
  I already made a “can has” joke with the Attention Deficit
  review, so I’ll refrain from doing so here. Guitar at 0:22! It’s
  quite epic, I must say, and quite a counterpoint to the previous
  track. The riffs repeat until 1:14, when they enter a new cycle.
  I’m just waiting for the guitar solo. This has an awesome
  atmosphere. Add in the fact it keeps switching styles (at 1:54 is
  a good example). And the guitar solo comes in at about 2:08. This
  a very crazy song… I love it!! It keeps switching between guitar
  and keys. Fake ending at 2:52. It leads into even more epic
  guitar at 3:04 or so that comes right back into the riffs used
  earlier in the track. Suddenly, Strago’s theme from Final Fantasy
  VI popped into my head. Explosion at 3:47 or so ends it.
</p>
<p>
  7. Dj Mokram – The Desert Had a Strange Dream (The Dragon Gave a
  Loud Scream) 3:20
</p>
<p>
  The title sounds like what a nearly-deaf person would hear the
  source’s name as. This has a very Arabic feel to it; I’m liking
  it a lot. A nice mix-up at 1:14 or so. Great usage of
  instruments; this reminds me Airflare Valley, another Mokram
  track. Maybe it’s just the desert vibe that does it. Change-up at
  2:22 or so. It builds up and builds up until the finale at 3:16.
</p>
<p>
  8. ProtoDome – The NiGHT Has Just Begun… (Under Construction)
  2:39
</p>
<p>
  Time for more ProtoDome insanity? The answer is yes! I just can’t
  get away from this guy!! Nice lyrics, and the singing is pretty
  good too! The instrumenatation is really well done also. Slight
  change-up at 1:22. A chipsolo at 1:42 or so. Doo-doo-doo-doo,
  dah-de-dah…
</p>
<p>
  9. Tryezz feat. DiGi Valentine – New Jack Mantle (The Mantle)
  4:27
</p>
<p>
  Sounds awesomely ominous at first, but just gets funky
  afterwards. Rapping comes in at 0:44 or so. “The beat takes a
  hold of you…” This line is certainly true; I can’t stop grooving.
  Nice little changeup at 1:43 or so. More lyrics at 2:15 or so,
  and main verse at 2:40. “Bounce, bounce, bounce, let me see ya,
  bounce, bounce, bounce, everybody bounce!” This is also true. I’m
  bouncing as well! How did they know?!? Another nice changeup at
  3:56, except this one heralds the end, as it quickly fades away
  into memory.
</p>
<p>
  10. audio fidelity, Josh Dunlap, Eric Griffin, Ben Charles –
  Slumber on a City Corner (Dreams Dreams : In Silent Memory) 4:52
</p>
<p>
  Ooh, jazzy! We last saw Eric Griffin in connection to Jay on
  Heroes vs. Villains, but this time we have two new collaborators
  with him! It sounds good, right away. Some horns at 1:25. A bit
  of a solo at the two minute mark. It’s quite beautiful. Back to
  the main melody at around the three minute mark. Flute solo at
  3:23 or so. Back to the main melody at 3:58 once more. One hell
  of a soundscape at this point which can only mean one thing;
  gradual fade out from 4:36 or so until the end.
</p>
<p>
  11. Level 99, prophetik, Avaris – The Nemesis Schema (NiGHTS and
  Reala) 5:06
</p>
<p>
  “The songs I’m most proud of that I have in progress are one
  track for the NiGHTS project, called The Nemesis Schema…” So
  spoke Stevo when I interviewed him last year. Let’s see what his
  pride and joy has become. Right off the bat, it’s quite ominous.
  0:15 begins a very creepy vocal clip. I’m guessing that’s Reala.
  Epic guitar at 0:36. I can feel the intensity of the track right
  off the bat; this is one hell of a face-off between the two. I
  can now see why Stevo was so proud of this song even at that
  time. More awesome guitar at 1:58. Clock ticking at 2:36 or so,
  quickly joined by prophetik on the sax. This really breaks up the
  song while retaining the breakneck speed it had previously.
  Seriously, this tempo is like hypersonic. Or not; if it was, I
  couldn’t hear the extremely high levels of epicity contained
  within. Stevo’s guitar picks up shortly after the sax, and at
  3:40 or so it comes back. Seriously, I can’t really keep up with
  the awesomeness; it takes the entirety of my attention, so quite
  literally all that is contained here is my train of thought while
  listening to this. And this song… it’ll be atop my most-played
  list in a very short time. Sudden end at 5:03. I WANT MORE!!
</p>
<p>
  12. OA, DragonAvenger – Tomorrow Should Have Been Last Night
  (After The Dream) 3:46
</p>
<p>
  And for a much calmer track to follow the previous. Main melody
  comes in at 0:20. Peaceful triumphant guitar comes in not too
  long after. Deia’s voice is interspersed for effect. Seriously,
  this song is like the polar opposite of the previous one, and
  that’s a very good thing. If it was the same, spontaneous cranial
  explosion would occur. A bit of a solo comes in at the two minute
  mark. Back to the main part at 3:04. A very calm outro for the
  song, and the 1st Dream, as disc 1 is called.

<p>
  I have never played either NiGHTS game prior to downloading this
  album, and I had actually not been exposed to its music aside
  from a cameo tune in Sonic Adventure.
</p>
<p>
  That said, once I started listening to the album, I was extremely
  glad I downloaded it. I haven't even properly listened to all of
  the tunes on the album, yet I know they're all of good quality.
  Now, if I get the chance, I want to try the original NiGHTS, to
  see what I've missed.
</p>
<p>
  In short, fantastic job to all involved <img src="/community/uploads/emoticons/default_icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":grin:">

<p>
  I was saying to Stevo, i'm kinda impressed with the amount of
  praise this album has received. I know NiGHTS was always a bit of
  a niche kinda game, not many people got to play the thing back in
  the day so i was always a bit worried as to how far this album
  would travel online ...but bloody hell has it surprised me. Total
  kudos to the whole project, i feel we went beyond what our target
  was.

  Whaat? Even tho I have that (in retrospect) atrocious bell sound
  in there? <a href="http://www.nightsintodreams.com/forum/topic/4190-nights-lucid-dreaming-in-review/" rel="external nofollow">This review of the whole album</a> even
  thought it was the most visually evocative track on the album
  even... ppl like my work and I'm just going "man, those lead
  bells are horrible" whenever I listen to it. <img src="/community/uploads/emoticons/default_biggrin.png" alt=":D" srcset="/community/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20">

<p>
  Also, Dj Mokram needs to do a lot more music... or rather, we
  need more Mokram music! And disco.
</p>
<p>
  Is there a log of the listening party?

  So, my 2 cents on the album.
</p>
<p>
  Whilst I honestly think that each and every piece has a very good
  quality, I cannot help but to find myself favoring certain
  pieces. So far, here are the ones that have by far more rotation
  than the rest (in no particular order):
</p>
<p>
  1-02 Dreams Dreams (Disco NiGHTS Mix)
</p>
<p>
  1-05 Reverse Rain
</p>
<p>
  1-11 The Nemesis Schema
</p>
<p>
  2-01 Beyond the Dream
</p>
<p>
  2-10 Dies, Nox et Omina
</p>
<p>
  Doesn't mean the rest is not good. Nononono. The whole album is
  great, I am just stating what my favorites are.
</p>
<p>
  Also I want to drop a few words about the great quality of the
  phsysical copy. The artwork is amazing and the print quality of
  the booklet, case and discs are up to par. An overall amazing
  production that was very well worth the required donation price.
</p>
<p>
  Somehow I wanted to review in much more detail. But I have
  nothing more to say than: that's a damn good album, fellas. kudos
  and congratz on a job well done!
</p>
<p>
  cheers,
</p>
