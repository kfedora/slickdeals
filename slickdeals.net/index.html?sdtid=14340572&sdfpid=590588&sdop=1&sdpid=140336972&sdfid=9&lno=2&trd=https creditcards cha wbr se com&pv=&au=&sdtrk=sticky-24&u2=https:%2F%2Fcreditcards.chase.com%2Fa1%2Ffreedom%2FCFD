            <strong>Cash Back and Points:</strong> “Cash Back rewards” are the rewards you earn under the program. Cash Back rewards are tracked as points and each $1 in Cash Back rewards earned is equal to 100 points. You may simply see “Cash Back” in marketing materials when referring to the rewards you earn. You may also see, “points” or “Ultimate Rewards points” when referring to the points you can use. <strong>How you can earn points:</strong> You’ll earn points on purchases of products and services, minus returns or refunds, made with a Chase Freedom Unlimited credit card by you or an authorized user of the account. Buying products and services with your card, in most cases, will count as a purchase; however, the following types of transactions won’t count and won’t earn points: balance transfers, cash advances and other cash-like transactions, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, race track wagers or similar betting transactions, any checks that access your account, interest, unauthorized or fraudulent charges, and fees of any kind, including an annual fee, if applicable. <strong>1.5% Cash Back:</strong> You’ll earn 1.5% Cash Back rewards for each $1 spent. <strong>3% Cash Back</strong> rewards total for each $1 spent on purchases in the following rewards categories: drugstores and dining at restaurants (1.5% additional Cash Back rewards on top of the 1.5% Cash Back rewards earned on each purchase). <strong>5% Cash Back</strong> rewards total for each $1 spent on travel purchases booked using your card through the Ultimate Rewards program including available airline tickets, hotel accommodations, car rentals, activities and cruises (3.5% additional Cash Back rewards on top of the 1.5% Cash Back rewards earned on each purchase). <strong>5% Cash Back in the grocery store category (excluding Walmart and Target) until the earlier of the end of your first 12 months or first $12,000 spent:</strong> You’ll earn 5% Cash Back rewards total for each $1 spent on purchases in the grocery store category (excluding Walmart and Target) made within your first 12 months from account opening, or until you reach $12,000 in grocery store purchases, whichever occurs first (3.5% additional Cash Back rewards on top of the 1.5% Cash Back rewards earned on each purchase). The additional 3.5% Cash Back rewards will appear on your billing statement in a separate line from the base 1.5% Cash Back rewards. <strong>3.5% Cash Back on qualifying Lyft rides through 03/2022:</strong> You’ll earn 3.5% Cash Back for each $1 spent when your card is used for qualifying Lyft products and services purchased through the Lyft mobile application through 03/31/2022. Qualifying Lyft products and services include rides taken in Classic, Shared, Lux, or XL modes; bike and scooter rides; and subscription and membership products. Purchase of gift cards, car rentals, vehicle service centers, miscellaneous fees, and other Lyft products and services are excluded from this promotion. Future Lyft products or services may not be eligible for additional Cash Back. You may see “5% Cash Back rewards” in marketing materials to refer to the 3.5% Cash Back rewards earned in addition to the 1.5% Cash Back rewards earned on all purchases. The additional 3.5% Cash Back rewards will appear on your billing statement in a separate line from the 1.5% Cash Back rewards. Lyft is not responsible for the provision of, or the failure to provide, Chase benefits or services. <strong>How you can use your points:</strong> You can use your points to redeem for any available reward options, including cash, gift cards, travel, and pay with points for products or services made available through the program or directly from third-party merchants. Redemption values for reward options vary. <strong>Points expiration/losing points:</strong> Your points don’t expire as long as your account remains open, however, you will immediately lose all your points if your account status changes, or your account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. <strong>Rewards Categories:</strong> Merchants who accept Visa/Mastercard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/Mastercard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won’t qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category.

Redemption values for reward options vary. <strong>Points expiration/losing points:</strong> Your points don’t expire as long as your account is open, however, you’ll immediately lose all your points if your account status changes, or your account is closed for program misuse, fraudulent activities, failure to pay, bankruptcy, or other reasons described in the terms of the Rewards Program Agreement. <strong>Rewards Categories:</strong> Merchants who accept Visa/Mastercard credit cards are assigned a merchant code, which is determined by the merchant or its processor in accordance with Visa/Mastercard procedures based on the kinds of products and services they primarily sell. We group similar merchant codes into categories for purposes of making rewards offers to you. Please note: We make every effort to include all relevant merchant codes in our rewards categories. However, even though a merchant or some of the items that it sells may appear to fit within a rewards category, the merchant may not have a merchant code in that category. When this occurs, purchases with that merchant won’t qualify for rewards offers on purchases in that category. Purchases submitted by you, an authorized user, or the merchant through third-party payment accounts, mobile or wireless card readers, online or mobile digital wallets, or similar technology will not qualify in a rewards category if the technology is not set up to process the purchase in that rewards category.
