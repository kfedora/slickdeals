To solve it, you should disable LAN controller, Wi-Fi controller, and Bluetooth controller.
To do it go in to UEFI in ADVANCED MODE (F7)
Chose ADVANCED 
ONBOARAD DEVICE CONFIGURATION
Realtek LAN controller OFF
Wi-Fi controller OFF
Bluetooth controller DISABELED.
Once this was done, I installed and booted to Win 10 without problems.
Later I enabled above controllers.

Downloaded Realtek LAN driver and installed it, then everything was working fine.

I decided to switch from Intel to AMD for the multi-core/hyperthreading capabilities. This was the most challenging build I&#x27;ve ever done. Previously I did my research, ordered my parts, put them together, and everything just worked. This time when I installed Windows it wouldn&#x27;t run for more than 5-10 minutes without crashing, typically with a BSOD. I tried various hardware and BIOS settings for the RAM, video card, and hard drive. I tried updating Windows and installing different versions, sometimes Windows would BSOD during an update or even BSOD during the initial installation. I was just about to return this motherboard because it appeared to be defective but by sheer luck I disabled WiFi and Bluetooth in the BIOS and suddenly everything just worked. I&#x27;ve been using the system for two days now with no crashing what-so-ever. I&#x27;ll state this clearly for anyone who may have a similar issue, disabling Wi-Fi Controller and Bluetooth Controller in the BIOS fixed my BSOD issue. I&#x27;m not sure if the issue was caused by one or both of those settings, but since I don&#x27;t need either of them and my system is working now I haven&#x27;t been interested in changing either of them back to test it.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">23 out of 23 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div><div class="comments-response"><div class="comments-cell"><div class="comments-title"><strong class="comments-name">Manufacturer Response:</strong></div><div class="comments-content">Dear Taylor M.,

I&#x27;m sorry to hear that you were having stability issues with this motherboard. That is absolutely not the type of experience we want any of our customers to have. As you noted, Wi-Fi needs to be disabled in BIOS to boot this machine when certain versions of Windows are installed. Once you update the BIOS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers, you should be able to re-enable both and have no issues in Windows. I will forward your feedback to the Product team for review. If you have any general or technical questions, please email me at cl-lane@asus.com and include case #N200512378 for reference.

Thank you for choosing ASUS!

This is the most heavily optioned and well powered X570 board given the build quality, power stages, phase design and UEFI options at a decent price. It&#x27;s hard to find any wrong answer when building an X570 system other than formfactor and this board is one of many shining examples in ATX form. Other overclocking contenders would be the Crosshair VIII Hero or Strix X570-I Gaming from the ASUS lineup. Gigabyte&#x27;s X570 I Aorus Pro Wifi looks equally promising and I actually passed it up for the X570 TUF Gaming. Pick one you like and start fragging.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->The more $$$ expensive boards in the X570 lineup up to the Hero literally make zero sense and the cheaper boards feel like a copy of what I can get here with the wireless stuff stripped out. ASUS clearly picked some cookie cutter design for the UEFI options as they all have vague explanations and the more important memory profile features have NO explanation. It&#x27;s not just in this TUF Gaming board but a number of them including the ROG series, which means if you encounter issues here, it&#x27;s more than likely present in other ASUS boards too, which to me hasn&#x27;t been a problem but worth the note if you like to move lots of legacy components around or plug in lots of devices. If I remember correctly there are two fan headers with swapped labels in the fan curve settings. They work fine but I have to make a mental note of what is getting power on #2 and #3.

Memory overclocking is the heart of Ryzen overclocking and coming from a Biostar board that has the most OC unfriendly options, this whole setup feels really weird. Not crazy, unpolished, unstable or unwelcoming but weird. It&#x27;s hard to explain but you&#x27;ll understand what that means the more you mess with the UEFI. It&#x27;s like Asus is holding my hand through the manual CPU clock discovery process then leaving me high and dry in the manual tuning bit. Another thing I don&#x27;t like that was a huge surprise: Memory training is a thing on these boards and extremely annoying. It took getting me away from 970 and onto these X570 boards to understand why people complain about slow POSTs that go on for well beyond 10 seconds. Other than that, I am not patient enough to deal with much beyond Tfaw and Trfc settings but you don&#x27;t have to anyway because Ryzen. When installing Windows, make sure only your target drive is detected in the UEFI and install from WinPE or your bootloader could go anywhere. Also be sure to install the correct network driver after install or you&#x27;re going to have problems of the kernel panic variety for any big Internet traffic.</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->Whether you&#x27;ve been sitting on B350 for too long or still waiting for B550, it&#x27;s hard to say no to these X570 boards. TUF Gaming has kind of a bad rap from prior blunders but got things squared away here. I was long overdue for an upgrade from AMD 970 and it shows. This R5 3600 is my first impression and intro to Ryzen and everything about this is outstanding. Sure I&#x27;m on two less cores but +4 threads and the 4K multithreaded performance is completely insane. It&#x27;s a lot of work to raise single threaded performance ~50pts but out of the box this is close enough to 500pts in CPU-Z that I&#x27;m not worried. The 7700K is slightly faster but doesn&#x27;t perform properly in my workloads, which means Ryzen was the answer. Who knew?

I don&#x27;t even know how I would cope with so many high threaded jobs or even single threaded VR without this thing. Overclocking is a completely different game here on out. Similar to my old ideas on overclocking, I disable boosting and raise the static speed until I&#x27;m happy with the speed:heat ratio or until it goes unstable. For me that is 4.1GHz on all cores. On totally overkill antique water cooling with a modified Socket A adapter, I keep this on 4.0, raise memory from 3200 to 3800, raise uncore to 1900MHz and lock IF to push this to peak potential. Since I&#x27;m running a Micron E-die kit, it needs a voltage bump from 1.350 to ~1.4xx just to reliably POST even on stock settings but it&#x27;s dual rank so I&#x27;m happy. I&#x27;ve considered doubling up on memory for 64GB but that may push my OC settings out of stability. I already go through all 32GB without a paging file, which means you will too. Keep that in mind when choosing memory as not all of it is equal and you don&#x27;t want to push infinity fabric beyond a certain point unless your memory kit sucks. You don&#x27;t want to pair this with bad memory.

If you&#x27;re looking for a great board for PCI-E 4.0 and 3rd/4th gen Ryzen, you will definitely want to pick this one up soon if not one of the other boards mentioned above. Things are about to get intense with Intel&#x27;s 10nm arrival and the typical market flash crashes. Also the PCI-E control of this board helped me eliminate a constant nasty unknown crashing problem with my RX 580 Red Devil. I don&#x27;t recommend the card but if you have one, they work great here and serve as a great stop gap if you&#x27;re still waiting for the 5800/5900 XT series cards. Another thing to note might be about water cooling the X570 chipset. I have lots of old blocks with mounting hardware and I cannot figure out how to seat any of them without obstructing a video card on either slot so there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;re not going to be reliably or effectively water cooling this thing until years after it&#x27;s EOL. These X570 boards arrived in the right place at the right time, especially this TUF Gaming board. Good job AMD and ASUS.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">17 out of 18 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/d/profile/reviews/THp0OTM3SmRHc1VRNzlGdjgvanJ1S0VFOVpPVUZiVFA%3D" title="View James S.&#x27;s Profile" target="_blank" data-t-events="A" data-t-e-var78="$ - Profile:THp0OTM3SmRHc1VRNzlGdjgvanJ1S0VFOVpPVUZiVFA=">James S.</a></div><div class="comments-text">Ownership: 1 month to 1 year</div><div class="comments-text comments-verified-owner"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> Verified Owner</div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-4"></i><span class="comments-title-content">Only used the board for 5 hours.</span><span class="comments-text">4/28/2020 1:44:18 AM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->Screaming fast with a 3900x Ryzen 12 core.

The person who mentioned the Blue Screen of Death is caused by the networking adapter is telling the truth. It mentioned the NDIS driver which is a network driver.    Its the Intel WIFI adapter specifically which requires you to disable the WIFI option in BIOS.  Install windows 10 and then go to the motherboard&#x27;s website for the WIFI driver and install it and then enable it again in BIOS to use it.  The driver that comes with the latest Windows 10 install is bad in 1909 build. Which is the latest build since this review.  The driver on the ASUS website will replace bad driver with a working one that does not cause a BSOD.  

Found out the ram I got was running at 2400 which indeed I have bought the 3600 one.   Found out its not called XMP in bios but DOCP setting that reads and puts in the XMP profile so it works at 3600 speed.  Which that really boosted the performance.   I will redo the review for this board if any issues arise.   I just hope the onboard audio does not fail like it did on me like it did with an ASUS 990FX R2.0 board which I read was common.

Also to those thinking about using the onboard HDMI or Display ports.  Those are not usable unless you install a processor with a part number that has a G at the end of it which means it has graphics built into the processor.  This is not only for ASUS board this applies to other mother boards with HDMI and display ports.   For example  AMD Ryzen 3 2200G   or the  AMD Ryzen 5 2400G will make the HDMI Display port work.   I would personally rather have more powerful processor than putting up with integrated graphics and use a real video card for your display needs.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">13 out of 13 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/d/profile/reviews/b1RqeEw2Z21PNTJaYU1ZbXE1eVhjZnBjUlJpQmp0d3E%3D" title="View Dean B.&#x27;s Profile" target="_blank" data-t-events="A" data-t-e-var78="$ - Profile:b1RqeEw2Z21PNTJaYU1ZbXE1eVhjZnBjUlJpQmp0d3E=">Dean B.</a></div><div class="comments-text">Ownership: 1 week to 1 month</div><div class="comments-text comments-verified-owner"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> Verified Owner</div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-5"></i><span class="comments-title-content">It&#x27;s ASUS, probably the best around there is</span><span class="comments-text">8/21/2019 10:34:19 AM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->- Like the RGB options, even though I&#x27;ll probably look at the lights for 5 mins, and then never again
- like the fan headers - plenty to go around
- like the BIOS configuration and customization options
- like FanXpert 4 software
- like that it supports 1st through 3rd Gen Ryzen, and 1st through 2nd Gen Ryzen&#x27;s with graphics
- The board has a setting, DOCP - enabling this allows you to use the XMP profile on the QVL memory to achieve memory OC timings easily without having to manually set everything.  This wasn&#x27;t intuitive in the instructions anywhere, so maybe it&#x27;s common sense for most everyone else.  This being my first AMD build since Athlon X2, it wasn&#x27;t to me.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->- don&#x27;t care for the new tiny fan the x570 requires on the southbridge, but everyone has that, so not ASUS&#x27; fault necessarily, so not deducting eggs for that.  I had one on an old Nvidia E* branded board back when SLI was a brand new thing.  When the fan went out - GRIND CITY - hated that I had to replace that fan every year or so.  Hopefully these fans are better now.</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->I&#x27;ve been an ASUS customer (not fanboy) since 1994 with my first ASUS 486 motherboard.  Had both IDE and SCSI on the board.  Pretty cool.  Even handled upgrading my 486 DX2-66 to 486 DX4-100 mod chip.  With rare exceptions, their products are just about top notch.  I&#x27;ve used other brands like M*, G*, E*, and I* boards.  They are good too, but when it comes to best features, best quality, best driver support, fan controls, fan headers, ASUS has always delivered.

I was intending to buy an X570 to pair with a 3400G Zen +, or 3000 series Zen 2, and for future support/expansion/changes in processors, I decided to go with the X570 instead of an x470.  Be aware, as you may already be so informed as I was not, 2200G, 2400G, 3400G, etc - are NOT Zen 2 or really 3rd gen Ryzen processors.  The 2x00G is considered a Ryzen 1st gen with graphics, and the 3x00G processor is considered a 2nd gen Ryzen with graphics.  I kept looking for 3rd Gen Ryzen with graphics which does not exist yet.  Once I figured that out, setting up the mobo, memory, etc became much easier...

As far as any changes I would make to the board, not sure that this change could be made, but I don&#x27;t care for the RAID software.  It looks like they are using a Marvel RAID in the x570 which I had previously using in an add-on card.  What I hate about it is that to install the Raid software (in Windows anyways) requires installing Apache for you to use the RAID software (like a local website).  At least with Intel onboard RAID solutions, you don&#x27;t need a Website/Apache install to make it work (don&#x27;t like leaving extra ports open).  I know I can mitigate the ports/apache concern, I just hate having to deal with that for an out of the box solution.  I&#x27;m NOT deducting eggs for that though.

Would I buy it again?  Yeah, I would.  It&#x27;s still a great board.

My setup I am building to replace a light use i7-4770K, 16GB RAM, GTX 470, with just this board, Ryzen 5 3400G, and 16GB of 3200 memory (Ryzen&#x27;s like fast memory).

For easy memory overclocking, enable DOCP and then select the memory XMP config in the BIOS (if using OC memory that has XMP).  I didn&#x27;t know what DOCP was on an AMD board, no real instructions suggesting I use that, and I found it through trial and error.  Not taking eggs off for that either.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">13 out of 13 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/d/profile/reviews/SnlzNUVnUlBHU1hUaXhoUXhQL3hkWWUrV2RaVmIvMlA%3D" title="View sam c.&#x27;s Profile" target="_blank" data-t-events="A" data-t-e-var78="$ - Profile:SnlzNUVnUlBHU1hUaXhoUXhQL3hkWWUrV2RaVmIvMlA=">sam c.</a></div><div class="comments-text">Ownership: 1 month to 1 year</div><div class="comments-text comments-verified-owner"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> Verified Owner</div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-5"></i><span class="comments-title-content">Amazing motherboard</span><span class="comments-text">2/10/2020 6:24:14 PM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->A gazillion features in the UEFI(BIOS)

- Great price to specs ratio; As of writing this, you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find another mobo this new with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and this much porting for the same price or less.
- Minimal RGB that&#x27;s easy to turn off permanently from BIOS, could be a con for some but I&#x27;m not really into the look.
- Inaudible chipset fan at default settings
- IO shield worked fine for my case (Enthoo Pro), no padding necessary as described in another review</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->- Can confirm that big GPUs totally obscure the chipset fan as others have stated.  This doesn&#x27;t really seem to be an issue for now, though.
- Mouse moves really slowly in the already not-great BIOS, almost as though the system is under strain, which is something I&#x27;ve never seen in my 20+ years of being a PC user.  Very weird.
- Some mildly lacking sections of the manual in combination with a few bits of text on the mobo itself that are intentionally off-center from their respective ports due to how close those ports are to the edge of the board had me doubting my connections a few times, specifically for the fans and case USB and LED power, though this is assuredly due to my inexperience with the build process.  I still got it to post on the very first try but thought I should mention it regardless for other beginners.</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->I have a feeling I would be less satisfied with this board were I intent on fiddling with the BIOS, overclocking, and that sorta thing, but I&#x27;m quite content as it is.  Solid board for a solid price.  Again, I got it to post on my first try while being far from the most experienced.  I&#x27;m running a Ryzen 5 3600 with 32GB DDR4 3200 (2x16) RAM and a MSI GeForce RTX 2080 Super with zero issue as far as I can tell.

If you&#x27;re feeling lazy about installing the latest offerings of BIOS and drivers and opt to use ASUS&#x27;s Armory Crate software to accomplish this, make sure you uncheck the extras under the &quot;Utility&quot; tab unless you for some reason actually WANT to use Turbo LAN, AI Suite 3, Google Chrome, Norton Security, and WinRAR.  Glad I was paying attention because I don&#x27;t want any of those; Do yourself a favor and just use Firefox, Malwarebytes, and 7zip instead of those last three.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">8 out of 8 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comments-cell has-side-left is-active"><div class="comments-cell-side"><div class="comments-name"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/d/profile/reviews/aW9sKzZnOTZ4UHltYjRFQzd1RlVDemNDTCtsdVh0Vko%3D" title="View CONAN S.&#x27;s Profile" target="_blank" data-t-events="A" data-t-e-var78="$ - Profile:aW9sKzZnOTZ4UHltYjRFQzd1RlVDemNDTCtsdVh0Vko=">CONAN S.</a></div><div class="comments-text">Ownership: 1 week to 1 month</div><div class="comments-text comments-verified-owner"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i> Verified Owner</div></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-title"><i class="rating rating-1"></i><span class="comments-title-content">covid-19 is killing the industry is my bet</span><span class="comments-text">7/15/2020 7:52:59 AM</span></div><div class="comments-cell-body"><div class="comments-cell-body-inner"><div class="comments-content"><p><strong>Pros:</strong> <!-- -->looks good</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> <!-- -->DOA, rma done after following manufacturers troubleshooting. still waiting on newegg rma dept for resolution</p><p><strong>Overall Review:</strong> <!-- -->24 years of buying Asus products and first DOA.</p></div><div class="comments-helpful has-button"><span class="comments-text">5 out of 5 people found this review helpful.<span> Did you?</span></span><button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">Yes</button> <button type="button" class="btn btn-mini">No</button></div><div class="comments-response"><div class="comments-cell"><div class="comments-title"><strong class="comments-name">Manufacturer Response:</strong></div><div class="comments-content">Dear CONAN S.,

Overall Review: I've been building my own systems for about 10 years. I decided to switch from Intel to AMD for the multi-core/hyperthreading capabilities. This was the most challenging build I've ever done. Previously I did my research, ordered my parts, put them together, and everything just worked. This time when I installed Windows it wouldn't run for more than 5-10 minutes without crashing, typically with a BSOD. I tried various hardware and BIOS settings for the RAM, video card, and hard drive. I tried updating Windows and installing different versions, sometimes Windows would BSOD during an update or even BSOD during the initial installation. I was just about to return this motherboard because it appeared to be defective but by sheer luck I disabled WiFi and Bluetooth in the BIOS and suddenly everything just worked. I've been using the system for two days now with no crashing what-so-ever. I'll state this clearly for anyone who may have a similar issue, disabling Wi-Fi Controller and Bluetooth Controller in the BIOS fixed my BSOD issue. I'm not sure if the issue was caused by one or both of those settings, but since I don't need either of them and my system is working now I haven't been interested in changing either of them back to test it.","name":"Eventually got it to work","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"3","worstRating":"1"}},{"@type":"Review","author":"J F.","datePublished":"2020-02-19","description":"Pros: There's way too much to go over but I'll try. This is the most heavily optioned and well powered X570 board given the build quality, power stages, phase design and UEFI options at a decent price. It's hard to find any wrong answer when building an X570 system other than formfactor and this board is one of many shining examples in ATX form. Other overclocking contenders would be the Crosshair VIII Hero or Strix X570-I Gaming from the ASUS lineup. Gigabyte's X570 I Aorus Pro Wifi looks equally promising and I actually passed it up for the X570 TUF Gaming. Pick one you like and start fragging. Cons: The more $$$ expensive boards in the X570 lineup up to the Hero literally make zero sense and the cheaper boards feel like a copy of what I can get here with the wireless stuff stripped out. ASUS clearly picked some cookie cutter design for the UEFI options as they all have vague explanations and the more important memory profile features have NO explanation. It's not just in this TUF Gaming board but a number of them including the ROG series, which means if you encounter issues here, it's more than likely present in other ASUS boards too, which to me hasn't been a problem but worth the note if you like to move lots of legacy components around or plug in lots of devices. If I remember correctly there are two fan headers with swapped labels in the fan curve settings. They work fine but I have to make a mental note of what is getting power on #2 and #3.\n\nMemory overclocking is the heart of Ryzen overclocking and coming from a Biostar board that has the most OC unfriendly options, this whole setup feels really weird. Not crazy, unpolished, unstable or unwelcoming but weird. It's hard to explain but you'll understand what that means the more you mess with the UEFI. It's like Asus is holding my hand through the manual CPU clock discovery process then leaving me high and dry in the manual tuning bit. Another thing I don't like that was a huge surprise: Memory training is a thing on these boards and extremely annoying. It took getting me away from 970 and onto these X570 boards to understand why people complain about slow POSTs that go on for well beyond 10 seconds. Other than that, I am not patient enough to deal with much beyond Tfaw and Trfc settings but you don't have to anyway because Ryzen. When installing Windows, make sure only your target drive is detected in the UEFI and install from WinPE or your bootloader could go anywhere. Also be sure to install the correct network driver after install or you're going to have problems of the kernel panic variety for any big Internet traffic. Overall Review: Whether you've been sitting on B350 for too long or still waiting for B550, it's hard to say no to these X570 boards. TUF Gaming has kind of a bad rap from prior blunders but got things squared away here. I was long overdue for an upgrade from AMD 970 and it shows. This R5 3600 is my first impression and intro to Ryzen and everything about this is outstanding. Sure I'm on two less cores but +4 threads and the 4K multithreaded performance is completely insane. It's a lot of work to raise single threaded performance ~50pts but out of the box this is close enough to 500pts in CPU-Z that I'm not worried. The 7700K is slightly faster but doesn't perform properly in my workloads, which means Ryzen was the answer. Who knew?\n\nI don't even know how I would cope with so many high threaded jobs or even single threaded VR without this thing. Overclocking is a completely different game here on out. Similar to my old ideas on overclocking, I disable boosting and raise the static speed until I'm happy with the speed:heat ratio or until it goes unstable. For me that is 4.1GHz on all cores. On totally overkill antique water cooling with a modified Socket A adapter, I keep this on 4.0, raise memory from 3200 to 3800, raise uncore to 1900MHz and lock IF to push this to peak potential. Since I'm running a Micron E-die kit, it needs a voltage bump from 1.350 to ~1.4xx just to reliably POST even on stock settings but it's dual rank so I'm happy. I've considered doubling up on memory for 64GB but that may push my OC settings out of stability. I already go through all 32GB without a paging file, which means you will too. Keep that in mind when choosing memory as not all of it is equal and you don't want to push infinity fabric beyond a certain point unless your memory kit sucks. You don't want to pair this with bad memory.\n\nIf you're looking for a great board for PCI-E 4.0 and 3rd/4th gen Ryzen, you will definitely want to pick this one up soon if not one of the other boards mentioned above. Things are about to get intense with Intel's 10nm arrival and the typical market flash crashes. Also the PCI-E control of this board helped me eliminate a constant nasty unknown crashing problem with my RX 580 Red Devil. I don't recommend the card but if you have one, they work great here and serve as a great stop gap if you're still waiting for the 5800/5900 XT series cards. Another thing to note might be about water cooling the X570 chipset. I have lots of old blocks with mounting hardware and I cannot figure out how to seat any of them without obstructing a video card on either slot so there's a good chance you're not going to be reliably or effectively water cooling this thing until years after it's EOL. These X570 boards arrived in the right place at the right time, especially this TUF Gaming board.

I would personally rather have more powerful processor than putting up with integrated graphics and use a real video card for your display needs.","name":"Only used the board for 5 hours.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"4","worstRating":"1"}},{"@type":"Review","author":"Dean B.","datePublished":"2019-08-21","description":"Pros: - Like the RGB options, even though I'll probably look at the lights for 5 mins, and then never again\n- like the fan headers - plenty to go around\n- like the BIOS configuration and customization options\n- like FanXpert 4 software\n- like that it supports 1st through 3rd Gen Ryzen, and 1st through 2nd Gen Ryzen's with graphics\n- The board has a setting, DOCP - enabling this allows you to use the XMP profile on the QVL memory to achieve memory OC timings easily without having to manually set everything.  This wasn't intuitive in the instructions anywhere, so maybe it's common sense for most everyone else.  This being my first AMD build since Athlon X2, it wasn't to me. Cons: - don't care for the new tiny fan the x570 requires on the southbridge, but everyone has that, so not ASUS' fault necessarily, so not deducting eggs for that.  I had one on an old Nvidia E* branded board back when SLI was a brand new thing.  When the fan went out - GRIND CITY - hated that I had to replace that fan every year or so.  Hopefully these fans are better now. Overall Review: I've been an ASUS customer (not fanboy) since 1994 with my first ASUS 486 motherboard.  Had both IDE and SCSI on the board.  Pretty cool.  Even handled upgrading my 486 DX2-66 to 486 DX4-100 mod chip.  With rare exceptions, their products are just about top notch.  I've used other brands like M*, G*, E*, and I* boards.  They are good too, but when it comes to best features, best quality, best driver support, fan controls, fan headers, ASUS has always delivered.\n\nI was intending to buy an X570 to pair with a 3400G Zen +, or 3000 series Zen 2, and for future support/expansion/changes in processors, I decided to go with the X570 instead of an x470.  Be aware, as you may already be so informed as I was not, 2200G, 2400G, 3400G, etc - are NOT Zen 2 or really 3rd gen Ryzen processors.  The 2x00G is considered a Ryzen 1st gen with graphics, and the 3x00G processor is considered a 2nd gen Ryzen with graphics.  I kept looking for 3rd Gen Ryzen with graphics which does not exist yet.  Once I figured that out, setting up the mobo, memory, etc became much easier...\n\nAs far as any changes I would make to the board, not sure that this change could be made, but I don't care for the RAID software.  It looks like they are using a Marvel RAID in the x570 which I had previously using in an add-on card.  What I hate about it is that to install the Raid software (in Windows anyways) requires installing Apache for you to use the RAID software (like a local website).  At least with Intel onboard RAID solutions, you don't need a Website/Apache install to make it work (don't like leaving extra ports open).  I know I can mitigate the ports/apache concern, I just hate having to deal with that for an out of the box solution.  I'm NOT deducting eggs for that though.\n\nWould I buy it again?  Yeah, I would.  It's still a great board.\n\nMy setup I am building to replace a light use i7-4770K, 16GB RAM, GTX 470, with just this board, Ryzen 5 3400G, and 16GB of 3200 memory (Ryzen's like fast memory).\n\nFor easy memory overclocking, enable DOCP and then select the memory XMP config in the BIOS (if using OC memory that has XMP).  I didn't know what DOCP was on an AMD board, no real instructions suggesting I use that, and I found it through trial and error.  Not taking eggs off for that either.","name":"It's ASUS, probably the best around there is","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5","worstRating":"1"}},{"@type":"Review","author":"sam c.","datePublished":"2020-02-10","description":"Pros: A gazillion features in the UEFI(BIOS)\nWorked right off the bat with my new Ryzen 9 3900X\nSupports PCIE 4.0 which will help the next time I upgrade my GPU\nSupports PCIE 3.0 for current generation cards\nMultiple PCIE slots for SLI/Crossfire of video cards\nAllowed my 3200mhz GSkill TridentZ ram to not only to reach 3200mhz, but go beyond it. (currently stable at 3266mhz)\nBoard runs cool, temps never going above 55c\nWiFi works amazing and gives me 800+mbps up/down connection to my AP which is across my house Cons: I had some issue gaming right out of the box. I would get massive stuttering and 25% or greater frame loss. I discovered a setting in the BIOS called Precision Boost Overdrive that pushes about 5 different areas of the motherboard including CPU past their intended voltage limits. After disabling this feature everything ran like a dream. I didn't deduct an egg in my review because this is a feature I overlooked during install and was easily disabled. Overall Review: I bought this along with a Ryzen 9 3900X and a Corsair H75 AIO cooler. CPU peaks around ~60c under full load, motherboard peaking around ~55c. I have it paired with GSkill TridentZ 3200mhz RAM which I run at 3266mhz without issue and a GTX 1080ti Hybrid. All around its an amazing board when paired with the right components. Highly recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to spend a small fortune on Intel products.","name":"Amazing motherboard","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"5","worstRating":"1"}},{"@type":"Review","author":"Anonymous","datePublished":"2019-10-23","description":"Pros: - Only my second build but still quick and easy to set up.\n- Great price to specs ratio; As of writing this, you'll be hard-pressed to find another mobo this new with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and this much porting for the same price or less.\n- Minimal RGB that's easy to turn off permanently from BIOS, could be a con for some but I'm not really into the look.\n- Inaudible chipset fan at default settings\n- IO shield worked fine for my case (Enthoo Pro), no padding necessary as described in another review Cons: - Can confirm that big GPUs totally obscure the chipset fan as others have stated.  This doesn't really seem to be an issue for now, though.\n- Mouse moves really slowly in the already not-great BIOS, almost as though the system is under strain, which is something I've never seen in my 20+ years of being a PC user.  Very weird.\n- Some mildly lacking sections of the manual in combination with a few bits of text on the mobo itself that are intentionally off-center from their respective ports due to how close those ports are to the edge of the board had me doubting my connections a few times, specifically for the fans and case USB and LED power, though this is assuredly due to my inexperience with the build process.  I still got it to post on the very first try but thought I should mention it regardless for other beginners. Overall Review: I have a feeling I would be less satisfied with this board were I intent on fiddling with the BIOS, overclocking, and that sorta thing, but I'm quite content as it is.  Solid board for a solid price.  Again, I got it to post on my first try while being far from the most experienced.  I'm running a Ryzen 5 3600 with 32GB DDR4 3200 (2x16) RAM and a MSI GeForce RTX 2080 Super with zero issue as far as I can tell.\n\nIf you're feeling lazy about installing the latest offerings of BIOS and drivers and opt to use ASUS's Armory Crate software to accomplish this, make sure you uncheck the extras under the \"Utility\" tab unless you for some reason actually WANT to use Turbo LAN, AI Suite 3, Google Chrome, Norton Security, and WinRAR.  Glad I was paying attention because I don't want any of those; Do yourself a favor and just use Firefox, Malwarebytes, and 7zip instead of those last three.","name":"The reviews had me hesitant but it's working great so far","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"4","worstRating":"1"}},{"@type":"Review","author":"CONAN S.","datePublished":"2020-07-15","description":"Pros: looks good Cons: DOA, rma done after following manufacturers troubleshooting. still waiting on newegg rma dept for resolution Overall Review: 24 years of buying Asus products and first DOA.","name":"covid-19 is killing the industry is my bet","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","ratingValue":"1","worstRating":"1"}}]}</script><div id="product-warranty" class="swiper-box-top"><h2 class="swiper-box-top-title">Warranty &amp;

Previously I did my research, ordered my parts, put them together, and everything just worked. This time when I installed Windows it wouldn't run for more than 5-10 minutes without crashing, typically with a BSOD. I tried various hardware and BIOS settings for the RAM, video card, and hard drive. I tried updating Windows and installing different versions, sometimes Windows would BSOD during an update or even BSOD during the initial installation. I was just about to return this motherboard because it appeared to be defective but by sheer luck I disabled WiFi and Bluetooth in the BIOS and suddenly everything just worked. I've been using the system for two days now with no crashing what-so-ever. I'll state this clearly for anyone who may have a similar issue, disabling Wi-Fi Controller and Bluetooth Controller in the BIOS fixed my BSOD issue. I'm not sure if the issue was caused by one or both of those settings, but since I don't need either of them and my system is working now I haven't been interested in changing either of them back to test it.","Pros":"Works as expected once the BSOD issues were fixed.","Cons":"It took me two full days of frustration to figure out that disabling Bluetooth and WiFi in BIOS would stop Windows from cashing constantly.","BoughtTimeType":3,"TechLevelType":0,"TotalVoting":23,"TotalConsented":23,"IsNewReview":true,"IsVoted":false,"VendorReplayInfo":{"ReviewReplyID":204578,"ReviewID":10422258,"Content":"Dear Taylor M.,\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you were having stability issues with this motherboard.

TUF Gaming has kind of a bad rap from prior blunders but got things squared away here. I was long overdue for an upgrade from AMD 970 and it shows. This R5 3600 is my first impression and intro to Ryzen and everything about this is outstanding. Sure I'm on two less cores but +4 threads and the 4K multithreaded performance is completely insane. It's a lot of work to raise single threaded performance ~50pts but out of the box this is close enough to 500pts in CPU-Z that I'm not worried. The 7700K is slightly faster but doesn't perform properly in my workloads, which means Ryzen was the answer. Who knew?\n\nI don't even know how I would cope with so many high threaded jobs or even single threaded VR without this thing. Overclocking is a completely different game here on out. Similar to my old ideas on overclocking, I disable boosting and raise the static speed until I'm happy with the speed:heat ratio or until it goes unstable. For me that is 4.1GHz on all cores. On totally overkill antique water cooling with a modified Socket A adapter, I keep this on 4.0, raise memory from 3200 to 3800, raise uncore to 1900MHz and lock IF to push this to peak potential. Since I'm running a Micron E-die kit, it needs a voltage bump from 1.350 to ~1.4xx just to reliably POST even on stock settings but it's dual rank so I'm happy. I've considered doubling up on memory for 64GB but that may push my OC settings out of stability. I already go through all 32GB without a paging file, which means you will too. Keep that in mind when choosing memory as not all of it is equal and you don't want to push infinity fabric beyond a certain point unless your memory kit sucks. You don't want to pair this with bad memory.\n\nIf you're looking for a great board for PCI-E 4.0 and 3rd\u002F4th gen Ryzen, you will definitely want to pick this one up soon if not one of the other boards mentioned above. Things are about to get intense with Intel's 10nm arrival and the typical market flash crashes. Also the PCI-E control of this board helped me eliminate a constant nasty unknown crashing problem with my RX 580 Red Devil. I don't recommend the card but if you have one, they work great here and serve as a great stop gap if you're still waiting for the 5800\u002F5900 XT series cards. Another thing to note might be about water cooling the X570 chipset. I have lots of old blocks with mounting hardware and I cannot figure out how to seat any of them without obstructing a video card on either slot so there's a good chance you're not going to be reliably or effectively water cooling this thing until years after it's EOL. These X570 boards arrived in the right place at the right time, especially this TUF Gaming board. Good job AMD and ASUS.","Pros":"There's way too much to go over but I'll try. This is the most heavily optioned and well powered X570 board given the build quality, power stages, phase design and UEFI options at a decent price. It's hard to find any wrong answer when building an X570 system other than formfactor and this board is one of many shining examples in ATX form. Other overclocking contenders would be the Crosshair VIII Hero or Strix X570-I Gaming from the ASUS lineup. Gigabyte's X570 I Aorus Pro Wifi looks equally promising and I actually passed it up for the X570 TUF Gaming. Pick one you like and start fragging.","Cons":"The more $$$ expensive boards in the X570 lineup up to the Hero literally make zero sense and the cheaper boards feel like a copy of what I can get here with the wireless stuff stripped out. ASUS clearly picked some cookie cutter design for the UEFI options as they all have vague explanations and the more important memory profile features have NO explanation. It's not just in this TUF Gaming board but a number of them including the ROG series, which means if you encounter issues here, it's more than likely present in other ASUS boards too, which to me hasn't been a problem but worth the note if you like to move lots of legacy components around or plug in lots of devices. If I remember correctly there are two fan headers with swapped labels in the fan curve settings. They work fine but I have to make a mental note of what is getting power on #2 and #3.\n\nMemory overclocking is the heart of Ryzen overclocking and coming from a Biostar board that has the most OC unfriendly options, this whole setup feels really weird. Not crazy, unpolished, unstable or unwelcoming but weird. It's hard to explain but you'll understand what that means the more you mess with the UEFI. It's like Asus is holding my hand through the manual CPU clock discovery process then leaving me high and dry in the manual tuning bit. Another thing I don't like that was a huge surprise: Memory training is a thing on these boards and extremely annoying. It took getting me away from 970 and onto these X570 boards to understand why people complain about slow POSTs that go on for well beyond 10 seconds. Other than that, I am not patient enough to deal with much beyond Tfaw and Trfc settings but you don't have to anyway because Ryzen. When installing Windows, make sure only your target drive is detected in the UEFI and install from WinPE or your bootloader could go anywhere. Also be sure to install the correct network driver after install or you're going to have problems of the kernel panic variety for any big Internet traffic.","BoughtTimeType":4,"TechLevelType":0,"TotalVoting":18,"TotalConsented":17,"IsNewReview":true,"IsVoted":false,"PurchaseMark":"1","MostHelpfulMark":false,"ImageStatus":"N","HasProfileLink":true},{"JobTitle":"","MerchantType":"","MerchantIndustry":"","Merchantsize":"","B2bExclusiveReview":"false","CompanyName":"","BrandId":1315,"TotalReviews":524,"SubCategoryId":22,"HasPurchased":true,"WebItemNumber":"N82E16813119197","Item":"13-119-197","BrandDescription":"ASUS","SubCategoryDescription":"AMD Motherboards","ItemDescription":"ASUS AM4 TUF Gaming X570-Plus (Wi-Fi) ATX Motherboard with PCIe 4.0, Dual M.2, 12+2 with Dr. MOS Power Stage, HDMI, DP, SATA 6Gb\u002Fs, USB 3.2 Gen 2 and Aura Sync RGB Lighting","ShowOEMMARK":false,"ShowOEMRetail":true,"HasVendorReplay":false,"ProductImageInfo":{"ItemNumber":"N82E16813119197","ImageTitle":"ASUS AM4 TUF Gaming X570-Plus (Wi-Fi) ATX Motherboard with PCIe 4.0, Dual M.2, 12+2 with Dr. MOS Power Stage, HDMI, DP, SATA 6Gb\u002Fs, USB 3.2 Gen 2 and Aura Sync RGB Lighting","HasWaterMark":false,"IsComboBundleImage":false,"ImageType":0,"IsDFISImage":false,"ImageInternalCount":0,"Scene7ImageInfo":{"ImageName":""},"NormalImageInfo":{"ImageName":"13-119-197-V02.jpg","ImageNameList":"13-119-197-V02.jpg,13-119-197-V01.jpg,13-119-197-Z01.jpg,13-119-197-Z02.jpg,13-119-197-Z03.jpg,13-119-197-Z04.jpg,13-119-197-Z05.jpg,13-119-197-Z06.jpg","DFIS360ImgFlag":"13-119-197_RY"},"ItemType":{"IsDigitalRiverItem":false,"IsDVDItem":false,"IsOpenBoxItem":false,"IsRecertifiedItem":false,"IsAITItem":false,"IsPhoneItem":false,"IsServicePlanItem":false,"IsSimCardItem":false,"IsRestrictedItem":false,"IsComboBundle":false,"IsSimplxityItem":false,"IsProductKeyOnlyItem":false,"IsMicrosoftDownloadItem":false,"IsCellPhoneWithPlanItem":false,"IsStandaloneSNETItem":false,"IsSNETItem":false,"IsCiscoServiceItem":false,"IsClearanceItem":false,"IsBOMDIYItem":false,"IsBOMPOSItem":false,"IsBOMBTOItem":false,"IsAvailableForRegion":true,"IsSubscription":false,"IsRegularSubscription":false,"IsCancelSubscription":false,"IsCommitmentSubscription":false,"IsSubscriptionOnly":false}},"LanguageCode":"en-us","ItemNumber":10411640,"Rating":4,"InDate":"2020-04-28T01:44:18.63","LoginName":"UBOJ\u002FYsUJXelEsgJw9fLfnRWTdM6Wvn0LsbcEeuSfNW0OYYeLXW5JPAfYTOyYvRhxh897Ab+jGg=","EncryLoginName":"UBOJ\u002FYsUJXelEsgJw9fLfnRWTdM6Wvn0LsbcEeuSfNW0OYYeLXW5JPAfYTOyYvRhxh897Ab+jGg=","Title":"Only used the board for 5 hours.","NickName":"James S.","DisplayName":"James S.","CustomerNumber":"Lzt937JdGsUQ79Fv8\u002FjruKEE9ZOUFbTP","EncryCustomerNumber":"Lzt937JdGsUQ79Fv8\u002FjruKEE9ZOUFbTP","Comments":"I did read the reviews.  The person who mentioned the Blue Screen of Death is caused by the networking adapter is telling the truth. It mentioned the NDIS driver which is a network driver.    Its the Intel WIFI adapter specifically which requires you to disable the WIFI option in BIOS.  Install windows 10 and then go to the motherboard's website for the WIFI driver and install it and then enable it again in BIOS to use it.  The driver that comes with the latest Windows 10 install is bad in 1909 build. Which is the latest build since this review.  The driver on the ASUS website will replace bad driver with a working one that does not cause a BSOD.  \n\nFound out the ram I got was running at 2400 which indeed I have bought the 3600 one.   Found out its not called XMP in bios but DOCP setting that reads and puts in the XMP profile so it works at 3600 speed.  Which that really boosted the performance.   I will redo the review for this board if any issues arise.   I just hope the onboard audio does not fail like it did on me like it did with an ASUS 990FX R2.0 board which I read was common.\n\nAlso to those thinking about using the onboard HDMI or Display ports.  Those are not usable unless you install a processor with a part number that has a G at the end of it which means it has graphics built into the processor.  This is not only for ASUS board this applies to other mother boards with HDMI and display ports.   For example  AMD Ryzen 3 2200G   or the  AMD Ryzen 5 2400G will make the HDMI Display port work.

Had both IDE and SCSI on the board.  Pretty cool.  Even handled upgrading my 486 DX2-66 to 486 DX4-100 mod chip.  With rare exceptions, their products are just about top notch.  I've used other brands like M*, G*, E*, and I* boards.  They are good too, but when it comes to best features, best quality, best driver support, fan controls, fan headers, ASUS has always delivered.\n\nI was intending to buy an X570 to pair with a 3400G Zen +, or 3000 series Zen 2, and for future support\u002Fexpansion\u002Fchanges in processors, I decided to go with the X570 instead of an x470.  Be aware, as you may already be so informed as I was not, 2200G, 2400G, 3400G, etc - are NOT Zen 2 or really 3rd gen Ryzen processors.  The 2x00G is considered a Ryzen 1st gen with graphics, and the 3x00G processor is considered a 2nd gen Ryzen with graphics.  I kept looking for 3rd Gen Ryzen with graphics which does not exist yet.  Once I figured that out, setting up the mobo, memory, etc became much easier...\n\nAs far as any changes I would make to the board, not sure that this change could be made, but I don't care for the RAID software.  It looks like they are using a Marvel RAID in the x570 which I had previously using in an add-on card.  What I hate about it is that to install the Raid software (in Windows anyways) requires installing Apache for you to use the RAID software (like a local website).  At least with Intel onboard RAID solutions, you don't need a Website\u002FApache install to make it work (don't like leaving extra ports open).  I know I can mitigate the ports\u002Fapache concern, I just hate having to deal with that for an out of the box solution.  I'm NOT deducting eggs for that though.\n\nWould I buy it again?  Yeah, I would.  It's still a great board.\n\nMy setup I am building to replace a light use i7-4770K, 16GB RAM, GTX 470, with just this board, Ryzen 5 3400G, and 16GB of 3200 memory (Ryzen's like fast memory).\n\nFor easy memory overclocking, enable DOCP and then select the memory XMP config in the BIOS (if using OC memory that has XMP).  I didn't know what DOCP was on an AMD board, no real instructions suggesting I use that, and I found it through trial and error.  Not taking eggs off for that either.","Pros":"- Like the RGB options, even though I'll probably look at the lights for 5 mins, and then never again\n- like the fan headers - plenty to go around\n- like the BIOS configuration and customization options\n- like FanXpert 4 software\n- like that it supports 1st through 3rd Gen Ryzen, and 1st through 2nd Gen Ryzen's with graphics\n- The board has a setting, DOCP - enabling this allows you to use the XMP profile on the QVL memory to achieve memory OC timings easily without having to manually set everything.  This wasn't intuitive in the instructions anywhere, so maybe it's common sense for most everyone else.  This being my first AMD build since Athlon X2, it wasn't to me.","Cons":"- don't care for the new tiny fan the x570 requires on the southbridge, but everyone has that, so not ASUS' fault necessarily, so not deducting eggs for that.  I had one on an old Nvidia E* branded board back when SLI was a brand new thing.  When the fan went out - GRIND CITY - hated that I had to replace that fan every year or so.  Hopefully these fans are better now.","BoughtTimeType":3,"TechLevelType":0,"TotalVoting":13,"TotalConsented":13,"IsNewReview":true,"IsVoted":false,"PurchaseMark":"1","MostHelpfulMark":false,"ImageStatus":"N","HasProfileLink":true},{"JobTitle":"","MerchantType":"","MerchantIndustry":"","Merchantsize":"","B2bExclusiveReview":"false","CompanyName":"","BrandId":1315,"TotalReviews":524,"SubCategoryId":22,"HasPurchased":true,"WebItemNumber":"N82E16813119197","Item":"13-119-197","BrandDescription":"ASUS","SubCategoryDescription":"AMD Motherboards","ItemDescription":"ASUS AM4 TUF Gaming X570-Plus (Wi-Fi) ATX Motherboard with PCIe 4.0, Dual M.2, 12+2 with Dr. MOS Power Stage, HDMI, DP, SATA 6Gb\u002Fs, USB 3.2 Gen 2 and Aura Sync RGB Lighting","ShowOEMMARK":false,"ShowOEMRetail":true,"HasVendorReplay":false,"ProductImageInfo":{"ItemNumber":"N82E16813119197","ImageTitle":"ASUS AM4 TUF Gaming X570-Plus (Wi-Fi) ATX Motherboard with PCIe 4.0, Dual M.2, 12+2 with Dr. MOS Power Stage, HDMI, DP, SATA 6Gb\u002Fs, USB 3.2 Gen 2 and Aura Sync RGB Lighting","HasWaterMark":false,"IsComboBundleImage":false,"ImageType":0,"IsDFISImage":false,"ImageInternalCount":0,"Scene7ImageInfo":{"ImageName":""},"NormalImageInfo":{"ImageName":"13-119-197-V02.jpg","ImageNameList":"13-119-197-V02.jpg,13-119-197-V01.jpg,13-119-197-Z01.jpg,13-119-197-Z02.jpg,13-119-197-Z03.jpg,13-119-197-Z04.jpg,13-119-197-Z05.jpg,13-119-197-Z06.jpg","DFIS360ImgFlag":"13-119-197_RY"},"ItemType":{"IsDigitalRiverItem":false,"IsDVDItem":false,"IsOpenBoxItem":false,"IsRecertifiedItem":false,"IsAITItem":false,"IsPhoneItem":false,"IsServicePlanItem":false,"IsSimCardItem":false,"IsRestrictedItem":false,"IsComboBundle":false,"IsSimplxityItem":false,"IsProductKeyOnlyItem":false,"IsMicrosoftDownloadItem":false,"IsCellPhoneWithPlanItem":false,"IsStandaloneSNETItem":false,"IsSNETItem":false,"IsCiscoServiceItem":false,"IsClearanceItem":false,"IsBOMDIYItem":false,"IsBOMPOSItem":false,"IsBOMBTOItem":false,"IsAvailableForRegion":true,"IsSubscription":false,"IsRegularSubscription":false,"IsCancelSubscription":false,"IsCommitmentSubscription":false,"IsSubscriptionOnly":false}},"LanguageCode":"en-us","ItemNumber":10352993,"Rating":5,"InDate":"2020-02-10T18:24:14.29","LoginName":"fnImTApAzgmJ8mfLP0m5KqJDm1EmSo60XaHYPa\u002FfBxdRf3D8pl6Gc\u002Fxjk\u002FWXNrED","EncryLoginName":"fnImTApAzgmJ8mfLP0m5KqJDm1EmSo60XaHYPa\u002FfBxdRf3D8pl6Gc\u002Fxjk\u002FWXNrED","Title":"Amazing motherboard","NickName":"sam c.","DisplayName":"sam c.","CustomerNumber":"Jys5EgRPGSXTixhQxP\u002FxdYe+WdZVb\u002F2P","EncryCustomerNumber":"Jys5EgRPGSXTixhQxP\u002FxdYe+WdZVb\u002F2P","Comments":"I bought this along with a Ryzen 9 3900X and a Corsair H75 AIO cooler.

Solid board for a solid price.  Again, I got it to post on my first try while being far from the most experienced.  I'm running a Ryzen 5 3600 with 32GB DDR4 3200 (2x16) RAM and a MSI GeForce RTX 2080 Super with zero issue as far as I can tell.\n\nIf you're feeling lazy about installing the latest offerings of BIOS and drivers and opt to use ASUS's Armory Crate software to accomplish this, make sure you uncheck the extras under the \"Utility\" tab unless you for some reason actually WANT to use Turbo LAN, AI Suite 3, Google Chrome, Norton Security, and WinRAR.  Glad I was paying attention because I don't want any of those; Do yourself a favor and just use Firefox, Malwarebytes, and 7zip instead of those last three.","Pros":"- Only my second build but still quick and easy to set up.\n- Great price to specs ratio; As of writing this, you'll be hard-pressed to find another mobo this new with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and this much porting for the same price or less.\n- Minimal RGB that's easy to turn off permanently from BIOS, could be a con for some but I'm not really into the look.\n- Inaudible chipset fan at default settings\n- IO shield worked fine for my case (Enthoo Pro), no padding necessary as described in another review","Cons":"- Can confirm that big GPUs totally obscure the chipset fan as others have stated.  This doesn't really seem to be an issue for now, though.\n- Mouse moves really slowly in the already not-great BIOS, almost as though the system is under strain, which is something I've never seen in my 20+ years of being a PC user.  Very weird.\n- Some mildly lacking sections of the manual in combination with a few bits of text on the mobo itself that are intentionally off-center from their respective ports due to how close those ports are to the edge of the board had me doubting my connections a few times, specifically for the fans and case USB and LED power, though this is assuredly due to my inexperience with the build process.
