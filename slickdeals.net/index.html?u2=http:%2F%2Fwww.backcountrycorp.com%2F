            <p>Concerts all summer, Sundance in the winter, and some of the West's best restaurants year-round—the local
              color is vibrant. You won't have to travel more than a few minutes to see any of it, and if you're looking for
              a little more of an urban experience, Salt Lake City is only 30 minutes away.</p>

              With 17 years of product, technology, and business experience, as well as extensive
              exposure to the outdoors sector, Peter Eischeid is uniquely qualified to lead the
              Technology and Product divisions of Backcountry. In his eight years with us, Peter
              has played an integral role in the company's growth, overseeing the launch of four
              websites and leading site redesigns, mobile products, strategic initiatives, and much
              more; he is presently charged with leading the Product and Technology teams,
              encompassing product management, design, and engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
              Peter started out in the Chicago area at Accenture and JC Whitney after getting his
              degree at the University of Iowa; however, after meeting his future wife, a Salt Lake
              City native, a move west was in the cards. The couple moved to Utah and, after a few
              years of travel back and forth to the Silicon Valley, Peter joined Backcountry in
              early 2009.
            </p>
            <p>
              A dedicated runner, Peter has run multiple marathons and completed his first half-Ironman
              in 2015. When not training, he enjoys camping trips with his wife and two active boys.

            <p>In 2010, Jonathan Nielsen made the move from Silicon Valley to enjoy “the greatest snow on earth,” and lead
              corporate development and strategy at Backcountry. As he puts it, “it was the best career decision I’ve ever
              made.”</p>

            <p>Jonathan led the acquisition and integration of Competitive Cyclist and later took on the role of EVP of
              Product Management and Design in 2012 managing product strategy and user experience design across the entire
              Backcountry portfolio. In 2014 his role expanded to include management of Backcountry’s adjacent category
              businesses Competitive Cyclist and MotoSport as well as European expansion via Bergfruende. Jonathan became
              CEO in 2016.</p>

            <p>Prior to joining Backcountry, Jonathan was a member of eBay’s corporate development team where he focused
              on M&amp;A transactions and corporate strategy; this included acquisitions in the US, Europe and Asia and
              marketplace, payments, mobile, and local strategies. He’s also held technology investment banking roles at
              Piper Jaffray and various operations, marketing, and business development roles at Ancestry.com.</p>

            <p>Jonathan graduated from Brigham Young University with a B.S. in Finance.</p>

            <p>After graduating from the University of Vermont, Jim migrated to Utah and founded the web development
              company Wasatch Web Works. The company would serve as his introduction to online business, and it would
              eventually lead him to team up with the co-founder of backcountry.com, John Bresee. Jim’s focus on
              cost-effective retailing led to exceptional year-over-year growth for Backcountry, and his passion for
              specialty outdoor gear has helped Backcountry stand apart from its competition.</p>
            <p>From rallying company Ultimate Frisbee games at lunch to long adventurous backcountry ski tours, Jim

          <div class="bio-body">
            <p>Working at Backcountry.com is Brandon Warburton’s dream job—it’s the opportunity to combine his passion for
              the outdoors with his expertise in ecommerce, all while living in the mountains. Prior to landing in Park
              City, Brandon honed his business and marketing skills at multiple companies, including IAC, Ancestry.com,
              Citysearch, and the U.S. Ski Team. His career at Backcountry began with a bang, as he arrived in the middle
              of the fourth-quarter holiday frenzy of 2008 and had to hit the ground running. The company has grown in the
              six years he’s been here, and he’s thankful to have been a part of the development. </p>
            <p>When Brandon’s not overseeing Backcountry’s marketing operations, he can be found skiing or mountain biking
              in the surrounding Wasatch Range or fly fishing in streams and rivers throughout Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, and
              Montana. Skiing was his focus growing up, and he honed his skills while racing at the Rowmark Ski Academy in
              Salt Lake City. It wasn’t until he arrived at the University of Colorado, Boulder that cycling and fly
              fishing started to absorb more of his time, and both have provided years of enjoyment since. Most recently
              Brandon’s focus has shifted towards his young family. He’s excited to introduce his two girls to the
              outdoors and spend time with them and his wife skiing, camping, fly fishing, and biking.</p>

            <em>SVP Marketing</em>
          </div>
          <div class="bio-body">
            <p>Hillary Benjamin joined Backcountry in 2018 as the head of the Brand Marketing team. The opportunity to
              help accelerate Backcountry’s efforts to build a strong brand and emotional connection with its customers
              are what brought her “out west.” </p>
            <p>Prior to working at Backcountry, Hillary spent 5 years at Rapha running the North American business out of
              its US headquarters in Portland, OR. Hillary started her career in NYC, cutting her teeth at an ad agency
              called Kirshenbaum & Bond that is best known for its award winning Snapple campaign. After a couple of
              stints at digital startups during the dot com heyday, she spent 8 years as Director of Marketing at Equinox
              Fitness Clubs where she was part of the core team that expanded the business from 8 locations in NYC to over
              50 locations in 8 major markets. She left Equinox to join Cycling Sports Group, where, over her 4 year
              tenure, she was Global GM on the Schwinn and Mongoose business, as well as VP of Marketing at Cannondale.
            </p>
            <p>Hillary grew up in Northern California and attended UC Berkeley. Even though she grew up on the West Coast,
              she feels fortunate to be able to combine her love of the outdoors with her career while living in Park
              City. An avid road cyclist who is quickly becoming an avid mountain biker, she does not own ski equipment
              yet, but knows just the place where she can buy some.</p>
