The wall was opened up about 4 feet since the doorway to the kitchen was so small. There was a lot of discussion about whether to just remove this whole wall to open up the kitchen and family room....but we really needed it for the fridge and some cabinets. Added a little shiplap to the wall.... There just wasn't anything left to go on this wall so I left it clean....#eyeneedsaplacetorest #iwastiredbythen Before After cabinets were removed! After All Kitchenaid appliances. Before I can't believe the sink was not under the window?? After Custom iron brackets and the butcher block shelves are from Ikea. The light is from Hinkley Rug is from Surya. It really turned out to be quite a nice size kitchen. The cabinets and countertops [raw concrete] are from Ikea Before Wider opening and painted all the doors which I will get the color for you! I can't remember right now. #braindead My favorite Grohe K7 faucet. Hello cute little mini watermelons....:) Hardware from Build.com Before After This is your basic classic kitchen....timeless! Well? You likey? So this is what we saw every evening when we came home... They moved about 7 miles outside of Boulder....and their are 11 cows a few feet from their property! And they did not want to take any of their old furniture with them....because they want new! Ahhhhh.....youth. Of course there is more and we will get to it soon...I promise I won't leave you hanging:) Thanks for hanging with me.
