Officials had touted the mandatory quarantine rule as an integral part of <a class="" href="/article/158fbfc9ce2145d26940999a4f3bc3c5">Hawaii’s early success</a><!-- --> in keeping the coronavirus at bay. </p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-78"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-40">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-43"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-41"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle1" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">But gaps in the <a class="" href="/article/virus-outbreak-travel-pandemics-hawaii-archive-1e552052192dbac3cbd8dc97329c811c">pre-travel testing program</a><!-- --> coupled with increasing cases of COVID-19 across the U.S. have raised questions about whether Hawaii is ready to safely welcome back vacationers.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">And when local restrictions were eased before summertime holidays, community spread of the disease spiked to alarming levels, forcing a second round of stay-at-home orders for residents and closures for non-essential businesses.</p><div data-key="media-placeholder"><div class="YoutubeEmbed youtubeEmbed"><div class="vertical-wrapper"><div class="vertical-limit"></div><img alt="ratio" class="ratio" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAAAAAAeQfPuAAAAC0lEQVQYGWMYrAAAAJkAAWzZLOIAAAAASUVORK5CIIA="/></div><div class="horizontal-limit"></div><div class="youtube-player" id="youtube-wrapper-p0GPDoNARDo-article"><img class="thumbnail" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/p0GPDoNARDo/0.jpg" alt="Youtube video thumbnail"/></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Margos ran into hiccups with getting her test. She first did it at the hospital where she works, only to find out it wasn’t an approved site for United Airlines and the state of Hawaii. She then paid $105 for a drive-thru test, but she was later informed there was an error with that test. </p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Margos ultimately paid $250 for a fast-result test Thursday at the airport in San Francisco, which came back negative.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Opponents of the testing program have said a single test 72 hours before arrival — especially when coupled with the option to fly without a test and still quarantine — is not enough to keep island residents safe.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Kathleen Miyashita and her husband were among those who came to Hawaii Thursday without getting tested. They said they plan to quarantine at their family’s farm on Oahu.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">“We chose to do the 14-day quarantine,” Miyashita said. “We have no issues with having food being brought in. It’s like a quarantining haven in terms of having fresh fruits and vegetables at home.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">She said she and her husband were “not at all” concerned about being asymptomatic carriers of the disease.</p><div class="Component-dfp-0-2-78"><div class="Component-adTitle-0-2-40">ADVERTISEMENT</div><div class="Component-placeholderWrapper-0-2-43"><div class="Component-visualPlaceholder-0-2-41"></div><div data-key="ad-placeholder" id="div-gpt-ad_site_article_midarticle2" class="DFPSlot Component-ad-0-2-39"></div></div></div><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">“We’ve been traveling, and we just take precautions,” she said, adding that they had already done one quarantine in Hawaii about two months ago.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Hawaii’s economy is almost entirely built around tourism, and local families who rely on the sector to survive need to return to work.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">More than 100 of Hawaii’s approximately 4,000 restaurants, bakeries and caterers have closed permanently and more than 50% predict they will not survive the coming months, officials have said.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Monica Toguchi Ryan, whose family has owned and operated The Highway Inn restaurant on Oahu for over 70 years, said the lack of tourism has been crippling.</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">“The restaurant and service industry has suffered so much during this pandemic,” Toguchi Ryan said. “Restaurants have not received any federal relief since the spring and are struggling to pay their expenses. Some restaurants have closed entirely, unable to pay for their rent, food supplies and staff wages.”</p><p class="Component-root-0-2-83 Component-p-0-2-74">Toguchi Ryan joined Democratic Gov. David Ige on Wednesday to talk about a new restaurant debit card that will give some unemployed Hawaii residents $500 to spend at local restaurants over the next 60 days.
